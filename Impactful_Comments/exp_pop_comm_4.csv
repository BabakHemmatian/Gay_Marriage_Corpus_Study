1866,"note to conservatives: the pope has said attacking gay marriage and abortion wasn't what Jesus's message was about, it was about love and compassion"
709,"Abortion, gender change operations (although this wasn't readily available too long ago), and gay marriage or relationships in general. Those are probably the top three I can think of."
1069,"Well it IS technically one way to solve it if they really don't want to. I mean, the law only requires them to treat it the same. If they deny all marriages, that includes the same sex ones. It's not the solution they wanted for sure, but it would technically fulfill the requirements of the law."
475,"You know it's ironic she connects gay marriage to ""pedophilia"" considering in some parts of the country fundamentalist religious people, like her, continue to marry girls that are 12 or younger in the US. This kind of rhetoric should scare people with its fascist undertones."
847,"And what exactly is the thesis here? That same-sex marriages will produce gargantuan, imbecilic coprophagists? I've heard a lot of arguments against gay marriage, but that ain't one of them."
342,"11 years ago I went to a huge anti-gay marriage rally put on by a group of Christians. I was totally against. There was thousands of people there and I was impressed. Going in I passed 15 protestors chanting silly things like ""2 4 6 8. God does not discriminate."" As I sat in the giant arena with thousands of like minded individuals I started feeling overwhelmed with the thousands of people sitting in here to condemn the 15 people outside. Not to get too religious (I was a Christian at the time), but I felt like we were the Pharisees condemning the prostitute that Jesus protected from being stoned. The next morning I realized that as a Christian I couldn't oppose gay marriage but should treat everyone equally."
358,I used to be strongly against gay marriage. Then I moved out of the small redneck town in Louisiana that I grew up in and saw how illogical the popular belief is in that area.
565,"In Estonia, as with almost any social issue, there is a major discord between the ethnic Estonians and ethnic Russians. For example [a 2017 survey](https://humanrights.ee/2017/05/uuring-eesti-inimeste-suhtumine-lesbidesse-ja-geidesse-paranenud/) found that 56% of ethnic Estonians support same-sex partnership and 47% same-sex marriage, while only 21% of ethnic Russians support same-sex partnership and 20% same-sex marriage. If for Estonians in general it's over 50%, then for ethnic Estonian youth it must be way higher."
209,"I actually saw one argument recently from someone against same-sex marriage here in Australia that ""the gays all want to get married because all they think about is sex. They just want to get married so they can have sex"". Fucking amazing."
1373,"The problem is that some states need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Imagine the nightmare we'd be facing if the SCOTUS hadn't settled the issue of marriage equality, where marriages are recognized differently, or not at all, in some states compared to others. The US is a union, and the actions of one state affect people living outside that state. Nothing exists in a vacuum."
1768,"My best guess is 1 gay marriage means 1 less straight marriage which means 1 to whatever less children, each being an ""abortion."""
1513,Same sex marriage dooms nations? Can someone rationalise that for me? I mean.. like how? whats the actual process involved? Plate subduction? Undermining the proletariat?
455,"Tulsi Gabbard is looking like an awesome future candidate for President. I watched an interview with her once explaining her ""evolution"" on LGBT issues (her father was a former Republican, now Democrat and strongly anti-marriage equality). The conversation and the change of heart came across as very genuine. She has military experience, city/state/national government experience, her upbringing exposed her to a variety of cultures and religions. She's Hindu/Unitarian. She's American/Samoan with a solid focus on native rights and also looking at how immigration can be reformed. She's now gotten some exposure in the national spotlight. She's a very composed and intelligent person and aligns easily with the Sander's camp. It's not hard to think of her campaigning in that position in the future."

546,"...but sometimes I am a moderate; it depends on the crowd I am in front of. Mostly people call me pragmatic as to avoid actually remaining consistent on the same critiques they raise about/to other candidates. Oh! Also I am a woman! So, no one is more of an outsider than I am. But please don't worry about it. I'm just your run-of-the-mill progressive that is for the death penalty, never met a war I didn't like and thought gays shouldn't be given the right to get married as late as 2011."
1499,"Many nations today still have slavery, widespread genocide, and zero rights for women. I don't think anyone in those countries is going to be feeling too awkward about marriage equality for a very long time."

151,"This is actually good for the GOP, in a sense, because they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads. The SCOTUS took care of that. So one of their contentious issues is no longer a problem."
1327,But the headline posted here tries to make it about gay marriage where it really isn't. I think the clarification is needed considering the post title.
313,The U.S. is far from last on this issue. It's when Arabic countries begin legalizing gay marriage that you find yourself at the back of the pack.
961,"What's important is that Jesus was *very against* gay marriage, even though he never said it or implied it. Also, when he said ""give away your wealth to the poor, feed the hungry and clothe the sick"", he *actually* meant, ""abortions are bad""."
419,"My mother in law used that site quite a bit, but can't register my husband and I as married because they don't permit gay marriages to be entered. I believe the company is owned by the LDS church."
37,"During Highschool my mom was the ""Stiflers mom"" of my group of friends. It also sucked that Her brother married a ridiculously hot French woman. I gave out a lot of dead arms on the daily via punching because words would not make them shut up about them having lesbian sex. Weirdly enough a decade later my hand clenches to a fist everytime my aunt and mom hug, as if to anticipate the lewd comment from a highschool friend that would undoubtedly follow any interaction between the two."
52,He opened a hairdressing salon with the guy he eventually married - an interesting outcome since he especially bullied the gay kids in school.

563,"Most people with an ounce of sense don't need to wait for hindsight to appreciate his presidency. He has presided over the longest continuous era of job growth since WWII. In addition to averting a depression and passing health care reform, establishing net neutrality as the law, integrating the military, respecting state's rights with respect to drug laws, made substantial gains in normalizing relations with Cuba, got Iran to agree to not pursue nuclear weapons, appointed two well-qualified women to the Supreme Court who; among other things helped to achieve marriage equality, And that list is just off the top of my head."
918,"My favorite response to his threat to move to Ireland is that Ireland has many policies that Democrats are striving for here in America. Universal health care, gay marriage, etc. I don't know what he's envisioning when he thinks Ireland will be a better life for a Republican."
436,"Yah, 5 pictures related to gay marriage seemed way overboard considering how many other pictures could have been in that album instead."
256,"Yeah, it's pretty much over now. Oklahoma, Utah, Texas....once this reaches the Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy would have to go against precedent he wrote himself in order to uphold a state ban on same-sex marriage."
153,"I feel this way about people who say ""I'm for gay marriage, gay people have as much right to be miserable as anyone else"". Hurrrr, so clever, witty, and original."
215,"I agree with the religious aspect. I am an atheist who is also a massive supporter of secularism, and THAT is why I don't think that religious organisations should be forced to perform a marriage if they don't agree with it. I think it's a good idea that gay people have the option to marry (Or equivalent) but don't take away other peoples freedom to have their own beliefs."
545,"Gay guy here, I'm very well aware of how much Clinton is pandering to our community and acting as if she's been an ally all along. I just shared the video OP posted where Clinton says she's against same sex marriage on the Ellen show in 2007 to my Facebook absolutely calling her out and comparing her history with the LGBT community to Bernie's."
1869,"I believe you're misusing the term progressive. You mean to call her relatively liberal (in terms of the American spectrum). Supporting gay marriage is not progressive at this point, for instance. It's the status quo. It's what the majority of Americans support. She does hold some progressive ideas, but they are few and far between, and she'd mainly provide the same moderate and slow progress in different areas that we've mostly seen the last 8 years. She doesn't want to levy a progressive tax against corporations and wall street."
805,"I agree, but while it (still) does so, it needs to be as equal as possible. Hence I support gay marriage."
1094,If someone can deny issuing marriage certificates to gay couples and if corporations don't have to provide certain health benefits even though required by law- then the rockettes can give a big FUCK YOU to donald tump and not be at risk of losing their jobs.
484,"I have been saying this for years. Feeding lies, fear and hate now they have a candidate who does nothing but feed lies, fear and hate. All the while they scream about abortions, trans in bathrooms, gays getting married but they truly don't give a shit. It has all been for the purpose of distraction so people wouldn't pay attention to what they were really doing, which was nothing to help our country. All their efforts have been to help the wealthy get richer everyone else be damn. They blame the poor, they blame the black guy in the white house, they blame people of color, they blame gays, atheist and liberals for the state we are in. They never take responsibility for anything."
917,"Just because the corporation is against gay marriage, does not mean that the people who work there are against it too."
380,"I've heard some people say ""it doesn't affect me so I won't vote"" to which I replied that's exactly the point! If it isn't going to effect you but will bring happiness and joy to someone else's life then you'd be a cruel fool not to vote yes for gay marriage."
364,"In Jacksonville, FL they just stopped courthouse weddings so they would not have to deal with any gay marriages. One step forward, two steps back."
626,"That's true, makes me think back to a recent thing on Reddit about a decline in gay youth committing suicide after marriage equality in their area. Probably too many variables to see if they were directly related but wtf is with people shaming and hating for differences. Tribalism might be natural but who looks back at civil rights progress and is like ""hmmmm probably best to be on the wrong side of history and be a dick."" It's sad when you hope people are just trolling."

1483,"Firing an employee for no reason other than finding out that they are a homosexual. Apparently this is still legal in many states, and is becoming more and more common now that all states must recognize same-sex marriages.

1852,"Considering 95% of men and 40% of women have reported using porn in their life, I'd say this is the dumbest debate in the world next to the gay marriage thing"
1622,See what happens when we allow same sex marriages? The sanctity of marriage is out the window when a man can marry a raptor/woman hybrid.
518,Yes for science. My hypothesis is the second he is fully engulfed in flames he will regret the decision and realize allowing gay marriage is much better than being set on fire.
270,"He's right. The left is absolutely hysterical. Trump is the first president in history to openly be in favor of gay marriage before being elected, yet they paint him as a threat to gay rights. He has a history of hiring women and minorities to prominent positions, and they call him racist and sexist. The narrative they're pushing is so at odds with reality, it's mind boggling."
499,"how is gay marriage even a legal issue? it blows my mind. if two (or more, i guess) people want to marry, no institution should be able to stop them from marrying. regardless of sexual orientation, or any factor for that matter. its silliness. the illegality of gay marriage is as mental as racially segregated washrooms in my opinion, what a joke. too bad google and oreo dont team up and start a campaign to expose the retardation of government. would be a little more risky for business than jumping on the double-stuffed-rainbow bandwagon i suppose"
556,That's a pretty amazing way to quit the Republican party. Only way to do it better would be to officiate over an interracial same-sex marriage before immediately giving one of the brides an abortion.
1905,"I imagine every news room is stoked. They got to transition from legalization of gay marriage, to the President giving a eulogy for the victim of a hate crime (with bonus Obama singing!), to one escaped prisoner shot and one on the loose with like basically no time in between. Any one of those things could carry an evening news block or front page tomorrow by itself and they got all of them in a day."
763,"It is not just LGBTQ that could be refused. Unmarried parents could be targeted and unmarried couples that live together. So I assume that an apartment manager would be able to refuse to rent to an unmarried couple, for example."
186,"I was just starting to date her (like 4-5 dates in) and the 2012 elections were going on. I was sorta like you know I don't agree, but I can understand why people would vote for Romney from an economic/foreign policy stand point, but what about social issues like abortion and gay marriage. To clarify at this point I assumed she was liberal because most of my school is very liberal. To which she responded, ""I don't believe in gay marriage."" Surprised I inquired as to why and she said ""Gay people disgust me."" I awkwardly finished the date and never spoke to her again."
1414,"Except it's an answer to a question that wasn't asked. OP wanted to hear from the anti-gay-marriage supporters, but other redditors downvoted them all."

41,"Mulan. The dude is on conflict with himself because one of the soldiers he is training is attractive, and he battles with himself wondering if he is gay, then he finds out that it was a woman, and feels emasculated because she kicked his ass at a lot of challenges but finally accepts that he is attracted to her dominatrix side and marries her. Intense stuff."
53,"When I was 16, my parents and I were in the process of moving to another state. My parents would go to the state we were moving to every month to look for houses. During one of their trips, it was supposed to be just me and my step brother at home for 4 days. Shortly after they left, my step brother tells me he's going on a trip for 2 of those days to go visit a ""friend"". The thing about him was, he had no friends. He was home schooled and kinda of a asshole, with no social skills. It didn't really bug me though, 2 days home alone when you're a 16 year old punk seemed awesome. When he comes home, I decided to figure out what he did. He said it was a romantic trip. After a while, I finally got it out of him. He met another man on adult friend finder, and had a ""wild weekend"". I had no idea he was gay, I have no problem at all with it, but it was extremely surprising. After a while, he would go on trips every weekend, and wouldn't tell my parents anything. Finally, my mom is begging me to tell her if I knew anything, and I caved. I had to tell my parents that my step brother was gay. They are very liberal and accepting people, but this is when it gets wacky. My step brother's lover was a 50 year old police detective, who was married to another man. He had no hesitation on telling them that he was in love, and they didn't use protection. It made for an interesting summer."
1016,Do people who believe this is not a big deal not realize that gay marriage is still very much illegal in many places? Or the stigma that accompanies coming out as gay or trans-gendered?
606,"I would vote for him (if I didn't find third terms to be a non-starter). If you had told me in 2008 that after his two terms, the economy would have recovered, my house would be worth more than it was at the peak, people were no longer being denied health care due to pre-existing conditions, gay marriage would be nationwide, Osama bin Laden would be dead, relations with Cuba would be reopened, Iraq and Afghanistan wars would be over (maybe leave out ISIS), and we'd have a deal with Iran stopping them from developing nukes, I think you would have wildly exceeded my expectations. It's weird that the way everything played out over time, it feels like a humdrum presidency, but these are some big historic events!"
1019,"Usually another, bigger sub has been linked to the smaller sub. The smaller sub might have an existing culture with relatively predictable opinions and voting patterns. If there is a rather dramatic swing in votes or lots of comments from unknown users, then there might be a link somewhere else on reddit to that post which is bringing people into the conversation that otherwise would not be there. For example, religious subs like /r/Catholicism get a lot of traffic from feminist or gay subs whenever questions regarding abortion or gay marriage come up because some of the users in those subs keep an eye on the front page of the Catholicism sub."
498,"If this sub has taught me anything, it's that cashiers are loud and presumptuous, gay bullying is the number one cause of both the frustration of the elderly and gay marriage, and toddlers are worldy, experienced and eloquent."

888,"It means the socialist writers put in a subliminal message that gays can and will find a way to be together and get married. Turns out it backfired on them by showing that homosexuality leads to massive amounts of chaos and dinosaur attacks. Nice try, Liberals!"
1137,"If you have a step dad, they have no legal ties to you. They have legal ties to your biological mom, but not to you. You are not their next-of-kin, they are not legally privy to private medical information, nor you to theirs, their income and taxes have nothing to do with you, and visa versa. Unless you sign adoption papers, making them legally your dad. If you don't, it can lead to situations like gay people rallied against when they wanted gay marriage, where a hospital might deny you visitation rights or if he died without a will you would have no legal claim to inheritance, which is why adoption as an adult is still something people need."
553,I wonder how long until the Libs use this to make it sound like labor opposes same sex marriage. I'm guessing less than a week.

401,"Chic-Fil-A didn't shove anything in anyone's face, the owner said ""I believe in same sex marriage in an interview"" then the media shoved it in everyone's face. If you're going to complain at least do it right."
371,"When I was 16, I had this arrangement with a friend of mine who is gay. We agreed to marry each other if we were still single by 40. I don't think we really expected to stay single, but I guess he saw it as a real possibility for me, and this was before gay marriage was even on the table, politically. If we were still single at 40, we would get married, rack in tax benefits, and adopt a kid (these were our plans at 16). It didn't happen - I got married and he got into drugs and isn't doing so well. Haven't talked to him in 10 years. Sad. :/"
686,Plot twist Kim and Naomi actually support this person and they are giving the camera the finger as a way of showing there anger towards same sex marriage
237,"The fact that they'd rather get rid of their own right to marry than let gays marry shows that they are not trying to protect their own institutions, they just hate gays and want to hurt them in any way possible."
1526,"It appalls me the number of trump supporters who say, ""Oh no, he's not against gay marriage, he just wants to leave it up to state governments to decide what's fair."" Equality is not a decision dammit. It is an undeniable right to each and every citizen of this country. How is this still even a discussion?"
1983,"There was a pervasive effort to paint supporters of anyone running against HRC as out of touch with minorities, women and LGBT folks. This began subtly with her primary race against Bernie. The media could hardly discuss Sanders' success without mentioning that he was doing well with white males. At first I didn't think anything of it, but the frequency of this messaging became obvious. It was their way of signaling to minorities and others that Bernie was an old white man who only cared about white males. Nobody in the traditional media had the nerve to challenge Hillary's claim to ownership over minorities/LGBT/women despite her super predator remarks and history of being anti-gay marriage... even when a photo emerged of Bernie being arrested during a civil rights event decades ago. This tactic may have garnered her some support from underrepresented groups, but it also had the opposite effect of chasing away more of the white vote."
1670,"Uhm... you're... I hope you're not homosexual because we... uh... Oh, dear, I hope we mentioned this at some point. We're so embarrassed... We don't let homosexuals get married in most of the country..."
592,"It's important to emphasise, though, that even if it really was true that nobody had ever had same-sex marriage before now, that would be a terrible reason to oppose it. Some country somewhere was the first to allow women to vote, for example, but the fact that they had never been allowed to previously would not have given them a good reason not to change at the time."
305,"Sure, to appease her conservative basis. She can only win here: People will praise her for making this possible, but how are you going to argue against her for enabling a perfectly legitimate parliamentary decision that is supported by the majority of the populace? She did not support gay marriage in itself, she ""only"" supported the democratic process that enables gay marriage. Brilliant move."
544,"Fortunately, it was a girl horse. I'm in favor of gay marriage, and horse/human marriage, but not gay horse/human marriage. That's just gross."
585,"OP, this is a great video. If I were you, I'd add annotations with the years these clips are from. For example, I think it is relevant to point out Hillary was against gay marriage in 2008+ while the ""homos in the military"" video is from 1995."
789,"The ruling was geared towards same sex female couples who had children through artificial insemination and then later split where non-biological mothers either wanted custody rights or were being asked to pay child support. I don't think that would piss off the couples, just those special few who are offended by same sex marriage itself."
187,"I understand where you're coming from, but I would just like to point out that Bill Clinton, despite being an establishment centrist, appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg who has done a phenomenal job. The next president will very likely either shift the balance of the court to the left, or solidify the right's hold on it. If another Scalia is appointed, all those 5-4 decisions that hinged on a conservative justice having some moderate views won't be happening anymore. Gay marriage would still be illegal if the court leaned a little further right. I don't much care for Clinton either but SCOTUS appointments are just too important for me to ignore."
1833,"It's so ironic that after all this time of bigots arguing gay marriage would damage traditional marriage, now in the end they're the ones hurting straight marriage."

472,"The definition of marriage does not include homosexuals, but definitions no longer apply. Some people want to **redefine** marriage. O'Reilly is right in this one. If we can redefine marriage to include homosexuals, why couldn't we redefine it to include goats? This crazy gay marriage insanity absolutely will lead to all kinds of things like that."

57,"My cousin (now in his mid40s) first came out to his parents as a young teen. They freaked out and sent him to conversion therapy camp, which was a terrible experience for him. He kept quiet for a couple years and by the time he was ready to be more vocal his parents had done a lot of personal growth and became some of the most involved pflag parents out there. My uncle is always, always wearing his pink triangle ""I love my gay son"" pin. I remember different boyfriends being brought around their house when my cousin was in his early20s. Then he met his husband and his parents helped fight for the legislature in their area to allow them to marry. They've had I think 4 weddings though I may be forgetting one at this point as it's been legalized and then repealed and then legalized again in their area. Only one big wedding ceremony and reception where we all came in from out of town after one of the legal ones in the middle, most were civil procedures at the town hall where they waited in line - with my aunt and uncle who wouldn't miss it for the world and truly love their son in law as another of their children."
1209,I would definitely preface the question with a condensed version of this. Something like 'In the past lawyers attempted to prevent interracial couples from becoming married because it opposed their morals and sensitivities. What is the difference between the opposition of interracial marriage in the past and what is happening today with gay marriage?'

333,"Seriously, right? I mean anyone with a brain sees through that nonsense. The man tweeted out of disgust and anger after the SCOTUS ruling legalizing same sex marriage in 2015. The man didn't suddenly approve of it just because he held up a flag someone handed him."
204,"While it is sad, it is a start. Look at gay marriage in the US. It took one state to get the ball rolling."
334,"Kim Davis is just another hypocrite. She won't issue a marriage license to a gay couple, because the bible says that's wrong. But she will issue a marriage license to a couple who are on their second or third or fourth marriages, when the bible says that's wrong as well. This has nothing to do with religious freedom. This has everything to do with her own personally bigotry. If you're going to claim religious freedom on one issue, you can't turn around and ignore that same religious belief for someone else in the same situation. That alone should be reason enough to prove she was willfully discriminating, rather than practicing ""religious freedom""."
615,I'm like 99% sure that in her mind there was a civil rights movement where straight people weren't allowed to get married and were hosed down by cops and shot in the streets and they were brave and proud and worked hard for their marriage rights while gays just walked up with no effort.
1917,The latest episodes of Arthur actually tackle topics like autism and gay marriage. Obviously far from depicting extreme poverty but it doesn't completely avoid any controversy.
619,I support gay marriage but even I recognize the idiocy of comparing someone against it to a Nazi. That's more trashy to me.
1892,"Wouldn't that have the ideal moment to respond with ""77% of Americans favor gay marriage. Are you also sick of protecting the minority of bigots?"""
251,"Nobody has ever argued that same sex marriage is ""gay privilege"". Churches don't pay taxes because they are non-profits, not because they are churches. Plus, gay people are allowed that exact same tax-free privilege if they start their own church or any other non-profit. They should really be careful with that edge. They are in grave danger of being cut."
42,"This one time about 6 years ago, I met this guy at a friend's house and he was gay. We had a good time chatting and he asked me if I wanted to go on a date. I didn't know what to say so I said yes. Now we are married and have a house. That's pretty much the gayest thing I have ever done."

824,"She also was married to a man who turned out to be gay, and then went on to study homosexuality and write a book where she concluded that it should be immediately legalized and tolerated. In India. In the 1970s."
1668,"Exactly. If your history class didn't need to memorize when interracial marriage was passed (mine didn't), they probably won't need you to memorize when gay marriage was passed."
304,"This is the first American president to embrace marriage equality! I'm so happy, but still wondering... what took so damn long?"
1882,"I know I know, but Ireland is more there to bring home the point that every Native-English speaking nation has legalised same-sex marriage except Australia."
166,"The fact that this post title doesn't say ""lesbian marriage proposal"" and just says ""marriage proposal"" says a lot about how we've progressed as a whole"
34,"It didn't matter though because of the earlier Supreme Court ruling. Much as with same sex marriage now. It doesn't matter what your state law is, it's legal."
255,"You have no idea how it is for moderate conservatives, at least these assholes don't have a real voice in elections. All I want is to be left alone by the government. Do we need taxes, roads, education, police, and fire? yes, I'll pay taxes for those now stop butting into my life. I don't care if gays marry or not, we should just let them, the government shouldn't have any say in that, same deal for abortion, I don't want the government telling me what I can and cannot do to my own damn body. If I want to get high or not wear a helmet on my motorcycle fucking let me be dumb as fuck."
775,"Really, the choice thing is a red herring. If someone *did* choose to be gay I still wouldn't give a shit. If it was absolutely proved to me tomorrow that homosexuality was a choice, my positions on gay marriage, adoption, etc. would be just as liberal as they are now. Just don't hurt anybody and I'm fine with whatever."
22,"I fully and with great pride and thankfulness support the rights of all people, whether gay, lesbian, transgender, etc... They are all humans to me, and they all deserve protection under the law. Who am I to stop love or say, ""You can't get married?"""
1435,"I don't know about you guys, but knowing that gay marriage exists here now has hurt my marriage too. Whenever I try and make love to my wife, all I can think about is two sweaty, heaving male bodies joined together in government sanctioned disgusting decadent man sex with large calloused hands grasping and moist gasping lips joined with giant throbbing cocks oh god"
1968,"Conservatives tend to try and champion institutions, religion, and ""family values"". Comedy by its very nature seeks to deconstruct and mock these institutions. This goes back centuries. It also aligns more closely today with progressive values such as atheism, gay marriage, and anti-corporate ideologies. So yes, it is actually harder for conservatives to be funny and their comedy comes off more partisan and contrived."
1385,"If BP doesn't fix this oil spill before the firecane comes, I hope every single Guantanamo Bay prisoner is rescued by Ron Paul so that they can fill Iraqi shoes with overfished sea-oil and hurl them at Bush's corpse once it's been flotilla'd into the Gaza strip and suspended in a mosque that looks exactly like the world trade center towers except there's an airplane-shaped bomb suspended near the 96th floor that's shaped like the [Halliburton logo](http://tiny.cc/1vrv0)! Furthermore, gays should be allowed to marry cute kittens and/or Helen Thomas because the asshole, liar pope touched my ex's kid (btw can I get some advice for this situation?). DAE hate police and their tasers because you smoke a shit ton of weed and read 4chan once you're done masturbating? Xkcd Onion Linux Jon Stewart and my axe."
1611,"From my almost 30 years as a homosexual (well I suppose closer to 20 actually knowing it...) I can assure you it is nothing but natural. If I had gotten to choose, I wouldn't have chosen to be someone that was hated and misunderstood by so many. Would I change now if I could? No of course not- I love who I am and I'm happily married- but would the 15 year old me have chosen to be straight? Absolutely. It was terrifying at that age but nature does what it does!!"
75,"A girl in my English class wrote that legalizing gay marriage will create ""800 million new jobs in the United States."""
844,"Here you go. Gay marriage should remain illegal. The reason is that if gay marriage were recognized by our government, then we have no legal excuse to keep polygamy, first cousin marriages, or group marriages banned. The next group of people claiming to have their civil right of marriage oppressed may belong to this group, and they also are consenting adults. However, a great majority of Americans are uncomfortable with the idea of polygamy, first cousin marriages, or group marriages. Why are we giving preference to the notion that marriage ought to be between only two non-related adults? The number two is as arbitrary as the genders of those involved. Either you legalize it all, or you legalize none of it."
