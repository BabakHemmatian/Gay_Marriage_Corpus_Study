641,"This is the argument I always make. Governments shouldn't permit gay marriage - they shouldn't be involved with marriage in any way in the first place. Let the government offer civil benefits to any group of two or more human beings able to otherwise enter in to a contract, and let marriage, whatever that means to whoever, be performed by anybody who is willing to do it.

I don't think you've ever had an original thought. You've done average-to-good in school and you'll continue to do average-to-good in life. You'll settle down in your early 30s when you stumble across another equally vapid female who's begun to get those desperate thoughts that she might never marry or have children. You look as if someone took a boring as fuck, personality-devoid, mindless cretin, covered them in glue and threw them into Urban Outfitters in the vain hope it would make them look the slightest bit intriguing. It hasn't worked. You probably won't endure that much hardship in life but you'll go to the grave knowing that no one was ever truly *interested* in you and that, in the grand scheme of things, you have made no impact on anything whatsoever."
51,"I may be working two jobs and barely squeaking by, but Gays are getting married? Thats what I want to hear about."
210,So what's going to actually happen with the states that don't have gay marriage? Do they have to now legalize it? The SCOTUS decision just says that you can't ban it. Does someone in every one of those states have to challenge the courts there? Do state legislators have to draft laws legalizing it?

234,that's just bullies in general. They're also good at picking targets that will draw the least amount of heat; the gay kids weren't bullied 20 years ago just because some teenage jock really felt concerned about the sanctity of marriage. it's about finding the right people to take your fucked need to abuse out on.

Although same sex marriage had been legal in our state for a couple of years, my wife and I agreed to wait until it was legal nation wide until we got married.

With pot and gay marriage soon to be legal federally its gonna be a whole new world. 2012 end of the world isn't the end of human life, its the end of one way of thinking and the start of another. Pot...cash...crop...money! As someone already said here on reddit, The united states will be the only country in the world were pot is legal federally. We are gonna have jobs again, and money to burn. Money to spend on art and music. In a sense, a need will be created for GOOD art and music. Not something that is coldy manufactured by hitmakers. Lil B is leading the charge! He is proving that people CAN tell the difference between real and manufactured music! Im not saying Lil B are the next Beatles but they are making enough waves to make change. Moral of story, Lil B Rocks!!!!

353,"Gay marriage. I was picked on as a child. I had straight parents. The first election I voted in at age 18, I voted against gay marriage. My reasoning was that however bad I was picked on, having gay parents in my conservative area would have been worse. I was short sighted at best. I know better now, and I am proud to say I have taken significant steps to advance marriage equality since."
243,"The thing is that's not even in the Bible. It says that God only hates sin, but loves all people. I am Christian, but I'm also fine with gay marriage. It's a matter of me not caring what other people do. Plus, marriage lost all right to being ""holy"" once divorce became legal."
222,"This is so hilarious, given that Mormons spent something like $20 million to save the godless state of California from gay marriage and now BAM! They've got it right in their backyard."
350,"This gets said a lot but seeing as the primary reasons for fighting homosexuality seem to be religious ones, a lot of us consider ourselves allies in the battle for gay equality. I'm a married woman but I speak up when I hear the people in my area/family pushing homophobic propaganda. Add to that, there's only so many ways to discuss how God isn't real. At some point, this also becomes a subreddit for us to simply discuss common interests. Gay equality seems to be one of them and that's fine, I think. Lots of people who aren't gay want to see gays treated like normal folks. Judging by the numbers of posts here that deal with homosexuality, a good few of those are atheists."

295,"They did a few years ago to make gay marriage illegal. Currently they are stripping powers from the governor to obstruct the incoming democrat.

799,"I'm not even American, but I've lived in America for a few years now and it bothers me. The people are actually pretty far away from the stereotypes of gun-toting and racist rednecks even in places like Kentucky. I see a lot of Europeans complaining about things like racism in the US, but in Japan we're more racist against Koreans and other foreigners and Europe did have the Holocaust... The Europeans also complain about gay rights in the US but only 4 European countries allow gay marriages, more states in the US allow it. They complain about Americans being fat, but that shouldn't even bother them. The only legitimate complaint I hear is that America is the world police. I get a little sick of America sailing their ships through our harbors and not letting us have an army, but that's the American government, not the American people."

200,Hillary could easily speak about Gay Marriage on this one. It's an issue where many Americans have changed their views in the last few years so her changing views would be understandable there.
226,"And here's the only relevant answer. I'm not sure why proponents of Gay Marriage have so many different arguments; the simplest and most direct is that gay people are being treated unequally under the law, which violates the 14th Amendment."
329,"I find it hilarious how the ballot initiative from the last election pretty much backfired and created this movement for Minnesota. Same-sex marriage was inevitable, but we can thank the Republicans for speeding up the process. I'm sure they're kicking themselves now."
1129,"Yes and no. Public perception means a lot. Gay marriage got a lot more traction as an issue when it became 'marriage equality'. Say you're a feminist and people roll their eyes, say you believe in gender equality, and they nod agreement."
1480,"Come on, this guy is getting downvoted?? Rick said that ""7 or 8"" of the California universities don't have a history class.

524,"I know someone who is gay but he is married and has 2 children, just to get those 2 children. He will soon divorce but the girl he ""likes"" (not loves in his opinion) didn't want children before marriage so he first had to marry. After the marriage he could get children with her, what was the main thing he wanted from the relationship."
129,"As a European, what a load of idealistic garbage. Holy shit can you sound more full of yourself. Yes, I do agree with SOME of the ideas like that most people do think that government is a force for good, and should be fixed and not toppled. I can agree that in some sense SOME European nations see themselves more as collective. And I think some of the stuff about investing in schools and healthcare is true. But a lot of this is some real revisionist history... America may not be perfect, far from it. But it's not some 19th century hellscape. This thing about genociding your neighbors and whatever. Like Europe didn't have and still has it's own share of racism and things we'd quite like to forget about. I'll remind you the U.S. gay marriage before a great deal of European countries, abortion is still illegal in Ireland!?! Europe is undeniably more progressive in many senses, but this just reads as a big circle jerk, that WAY oversimplifies the complex nature of nations and history."

593,"This video is a pretty accurate depiction of who she is and what she's about. Talking over people, interrupting, not listening at all, dodging questions. Anti-vaccine, wanted to ban same sex marriage, climate change denier, you name it..."
276,"It's important to understand that there is a difference between legal marriage and religious marriage. The Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage stated that it is unconstitutional for a state to deny a marriage license to two gay people, thereby denying them the right to get *legally* married. The article you posted about the bill says that the bill states that you cannot force a pastor or religious leader to perform a marriage for two gay people. That's all well and good except you don't need a law for that, because the government already cannot enforce its views on anyone. You can't force a pastor to marry two gay people any more than you can force a pastor to give communion to anyone who wants it. You can call it discriminatory if you want but churches are under no obligation to be inclusive. The other part of the bill, which I imagine is the more controversial part, states that faith-based organizations cannot be forced to hold events for people whose views they disagree with. This is unrelated to the Supreme Court decision, and is most likely intended to prevent people from arguing that it's discriminatory for a church to refuse to hold a wedding (even if the wedding isn't religious) to a gay couple. In other words, churches can rent themselves out as a venue to whomever they like, but they don't have to rent the venue to anyone whose views they disagree with, i.e. gay people. This is more of a gray area and you could argue it allows for discrimination, but it's understandable that a church that disallows same sex marriage wouldn't be too jazzed about being forced to let gay couples hold their weddings in their worship space."

687,"Exactly right. The government could introduce a bill to legalise same sex marriage, but the reason it's going to referendum is because we want it included in the constitution in order to to make it a hell of a lot harder to be repealed in the future should a more conservative government be elected."
474,"Anyone else think Trump is actually more pro-LGBTQ than Clinton? She was publicly against gay marriage for like 15+ years. Trump didn't, and in the campaign he basically avoided talking about it and said that it should have been left to the states but that gay marriage is the law of the land, and then would quickly move on"
600,"As an Irish person this is both mortifying that we have this draconian law in place, which is finally catching international attention; as well as massively heartening to see people around the world standing in solidarity with Ireland's woman and their rights. After hundreds of years of social and political domination by the Catholic Church I can say Ireland is most definitely waking up and walking towards secularism, as seen in the recent overwhelming referendum in favour of gay marriage. Hopefully with support from abroad we can push back church doctrine in favour of human equality and welfare."
314,"It is such an infantile argument too. ""Im voting no, not because I have a problem with gay marriage, but because advocates for gay marriage are too aggressive"". It's the adult, democratic version of a dummy spit."
211,"It is possible to think marriage equality should be the law of the land AND think the supreme court overstepped its powers with this descision.

134,"I like Stephen Fry, and I think it should be fine for gay people to smoke pot while they get married in an abortion clinic. Knowing that, when I saw the pictures of his marriage I thought it was a joke, when I looked into it and saw it was real I was completely creeped the fuck out."
152,Didn't the article say that they didn't have a problem with anyone eating at the restaurant but they wouldn't do something such as cater a gay wedding? They said they didn't support gay marriage but didn't discriminate against anyone at their restaurant? That's what they'll stand behind and get a ton of support. Shit like this seems very childish and counterproductive for the LGBT equal rights movement. How does attacking people for their beliefs give anyone any kind of moral high ground? If you disagree with what a business does you just don't give them any business and you tell others what they're all about and let them decide whether or not to give them their business.

594,"They probably knew, or at least ""knew"" in the Southern sense. There have always been gays, even in the South, but they weren't open about it. In my neighborhoods growing up, it was regarded as an open secret. The kind, nicely dressed 'confirmed bachelor' was regarded as part of the community. The film Bernie provides a portrayal of a similar sort of dynamic. For my grandparents, it would have been considered gauche to acknowledge homosexuality, and only proper to at least publicly hope for their eventual marriage, but no one really expected it."

I'm pretty sure the party line for Christians is if your job causes you to sin, find a new job. She wouldn't be pulling this shit at a strip club refusing to take off her clothes, she'd leave. But here she is, refusing to leave the job that requires her to sin, which tells me she values a paycheck and benefits more than her religion."

""Hey wanna go to the gym?"" ""Yaaasssssss queeeennnnn, I wanna see myself some future ex husbands"". I ask him what he likes to do for fun and he says being gay. Like dude, I love you to death and have made giant sacrifices in my life for you, but don't you have a personality? I don't like the idea of me being homophobic or what have you but I kinda do resent my brother because he doesn't even identify himself as my brother because he prefers me calling him my gay brother, where does it end?"
