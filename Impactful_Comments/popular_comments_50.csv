"It's important to understand that there is a difference between legal marriage and religious marriage. The Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage stated that it is unconstitutional for a state to deny a marriage license to two gay people, thereby denying them the right to get *legally* married. The article you posted about the bill says that the bill states that you cannot force a pastor or religious leader to perform a marriage for two gay people. That's all well and good except you don't need a law for that, because the government already cannot enforce its views on anyone. You can't force a pastor to marry two gay people any more than you can force a pastor to give communion to anyone who wants it. You can call it discriminatory if you want but churches are under no obligation to be inclusive. The other part of the bill, which I imagine is the more controversial part, states that faith-based organizations cannot be forced to hold events for people whose views they disagree with. This is unrelated to the Supreme Court decision, and is most likely intended to prevent people from arguing that it's discriminatory for a church to refuse to hold a wedding (even if the wedding isn't religious) to a gay couple. In other words, churches can rent themselves out as a venue to whomever they like, but they don't have to rent the venue to anyone whose views they disagree with, i.e. gay people. This is more of a gray area and you could argue it allows for discrimination, but it's understandable that a church that disallows same sex marriage wouldn't be too jazzed about being forced to let gay couples hold their weddings in their worship space.",2016,3,889,"[(32, 0.35188037), (16, 0.12503178), (23, 0.084663495), (45, 0.082401626), (17, 0.06453096), (48, 0.061397735), (21, 0.035835415), (5, 0.02973324), (36, 0.026768379), (41, 0.020712676), (31, 0.017407855), (30, 0.01722475), (18, 0.016956452), (40, 0.016391164), (0, 0.010903367)]"

"The Mother in Law hate here is scary. I'm a Mother of three sons. One of them is married and until very recently, I absolutely adored my daughter in law. She was the 'daughter' I didn't have. They gave me the most amazing grand-daughter. My daughter in law did, however, bring a level of drama to our lives, that we were not accustomed to, and that was hard to adjust to. Being a household of primarily males, there just was not much 'drama'. The DIL is 9 years older than my son, they started dating when my son was 19. I was very concerned about the age difference, but I always treated her respectfully and with kindness. They are amidst divorce now, and I'm not thrilled with her behavior over the past 6 months. My reason is that she knew she was dating a very young man, and they knew when they decided to marry and have a child, that the young man was still quite young. My DIL remains flummoxed that my son (who is 23 now) hasn't turned into a 30 year old adult, like she is. Some red flags did go off for me as I observed her own relationship with her Mother, they were quite harsh with each other, but I tried not to let that affect my acceptance of her and she became an integral part of our family. Nonetheless, she has treated my son poorly, and I no longer 'like' her. It has nothing to do with 'competing' with her. It has to do with how she is now treating him, and us.

"There is no such thing as a spoiler. Anyone who tells you that is a fear-mongering tool of the establishment. If a candidate does not win (in a fair election, which it's not, but let's pretend it is), they did not get enough votes in the right places in order to win, period. No one is entitled to anyone's vote, period. That's how the system works. The two parties have control over the system. If they are not happy about it, they can change it. You have the complete right to vote for a third party, even though the two parties and the media have created obstacles and campaigns against doing so. The Democratic party has spread lies about its supposed progressive agenda, meanwhile the only things they ever put any real effort behind are pro-corporate centrist policies that align more with moderate Republicans and moderate independents than they do with progressives. The party will continue to shift to the right on nearly everything, except a few social wedge issues (guns, abortion, marriage equality) in order to guilt you into voting for them in order to stop the Republicans. They'll do it because they can, and because you'll let them. They even had the gall to start a movement called ""Blue No Matter Who"" which is perhaps the most ignorant slogan a political party could come up with. Why would you vote blindly for a party regardless of its nominee? You should vote for whoever you want to, not who you're told to. People will try to shame you, bring up Nader as an excuse for their own loss and failure to capture enough of the electorate, scare you into believing Trump will destroy the world, accuse you of not being a true progressive because you aren't voting based on Supreme Court nominations, or simply tell you to grow up because voting for who you want is apparently what you do when you're young and naive. Yet the last several decades of elections have produced almost nothing for the progressive cause, despite the supposedly effective tactic of voting blue no matter who. The Democratic party will never change if you keep voting for it and it keeps ignoring you the day after Election Day. Apparently, third party voters are supposed to ""learn a lesson"" or so I've been told, yet the Democratic party can do whatever it wants, nominate the most corrupt candidate in perhaps the history of politics, and you're expected to fall in line. That's not democracy.

Mr Lively warned audiences that the “evil institution” of homosexuality sought to “prey upon” and recruit Ugandan children in a bid to “defeat the marriage-based society”.",2016,11,449,"[(41, 0.09636655), (3, 0.095249124), (40, 0.09420199), (22, 0.08539325), (4, 0.08471193), (32, 0.06146277), (2, 0.045500837), (49, 0.041702125), (28, 0.03946917), (16, 0.03806999), (45, 0.035479676), (1, 0.03228456), (0, 0.024638463), (35, 0.023696128), (7, 0.023489308), (20, 0.021881726), (11, 0.0200845), (29, 0.019973261), (9, 0.019852763), (36, 0.018833043), (19, 0.017838042), (27, 0.0146496575)]"

"Background. My cousin and i (both male) were having a sleep over when we were around 6 years old. We started talking about girls and about how they could pee, we couldn't figure it out so we started to come up with ideas. One thing led to another and we started talking about how to have sex with a girl, since we had never seen a vagina we thought maybe it was the butt. Curious we proceeded to put our little peckers into each others butts and just lay there. One on his stomach and the other on top, we would switch positions. At the time i thought nothing of it, but years down the road when i was a teenager i realized what the hell had happened. I tried my best to ignore this little piece of history and so did my cousin. But every time we would hang out as we grew up you could tell it was still awkward and was only getting worse. Fast forward 20 years and we are both married, out at dinner on a double date and we had an obviously gay waiter. My cousins wife remarks, ""i don't understand how they can have sex with other men, that is just weird"" I causally said ""its pretty easy"". Both wives look at me and i go ""what, like you've never had causal gay sex with your cousin when you were 6 before?"". My stupid brain thought this would be a good way to finally break the ice on the situation, i meant it to be so ridiculous that the wives would never think i was serious. Instead it led to a lengthy conversation of ""what the hells"" and ""oh my ****ing gods"" as my cousin and i tried to explain to our wives why we had gay sex in a walk in closet at my grandmothers house at the age of 6.",2014,2,420,"[(38, 0.38432792), (21, 0.1623542), (33, 0.12445883), (46, 0.09260812), (20, 0.06311812), (13, 0.042004857), (31, 0.02392273), (25, 0.022741124), (26, 0.017538821), (12, 0.0127178915), (1, 0.011569193)]"

Why was I wearing that faggy grey suit coat? She didn't remember our anniversary. I reminded her. She told me I was a prick for blindsiding her in public and making her embarrassed. People were staring. It made her madder. I tried to calm her down, but she went to the washroom in a hurry. She stayed there for 20 minutes, calling all her friends, whining about how I ""go ahead and plan things without ever asking her"". She comes back, she calls me names. Makes a scene. The waiter asks her to leave, but people were looking at ME and laughing. They think I cheated on her, betrayed her, fucked up somehow. They think I'm a scumbag and I've hurt this beautiful poor woman. She's still yelling. She picks up her wine glass and smashes it on my head. I fall out of my chair, and crawl a bit.

I figured they had got into some trouble at school or something along those lines, but then I saw the hand holding. They both started holding hands, and it hit me like a ton of bricks, that my sneaky suspicions of their relationship were starting to look a lot less like mere suspicions. My son came out to reveal that him and his buddy have been dating for the past two years, but ""they're not gay."" They then reveal that his buddy may indeed look like a young man, but in fact does not have male genitalia, and is indeed some kind of female. Keep in mind, I just got home from a long a day at work, looking forward to a simple night of steak and the Broncos game, unfortunately I got a little more than I had expected. The son's ""girlfriend"" then proceeds to reach over the table and whisper into my ear, ""ey bb wan som fuk?"" At a loss for words, actions, or even thought, I simply said yes.

"I was working in a video rental store in Houston, circa 1989, about two years after I graduated high school. In comes a girl that had always been awful to me from 10th grade to graduation.

I didn't even know her last name. I must have reminded her of someone...She comes into the store and sheepishly said that she wanted 3 dirty movies. She didn’t seem to remember me. She said her best friend was getting married and she wanted some dirty movies for the bachelorette party. The shop had a small 'adult' room that you had to access by coming behind the counter, but she didn't want to go in there. She asked me to select three films. She was squirming with embarrassment as I tried to find out what she was ‘into’ and kind of acted like I thought the films were for her and her alone. She said, ‘just grab three ‘good’ ones, I don’t care’… So I selected three all lesbian porn’s and she slunk out with them. I would have loved to see the look on their faces when they popped those tapes in. She returned them thru the night drop so she wouldn’t have to look anyone in the eye when she brought them back.

"Actually I have had something like this happen to me. I was dating this pastors daughter (I am not religious by any means but she was a freak and asked me to do it in her fathers church (just to give you a reference point of her)). But anyway we were coming back from the mall where we had this fight over a sweater I bought her. Let me preface this by saying in no way was she outwardly racist or anything. But she was kinda a slut, smoked a lot of pot, opposed gay marriage the whole nine. But around her parents she was miss perfect. So I went along with it. So I show her the shirt in the car, it was a nicely stitched sweater with a white collared shirt underneath to wear with it. She exclaims, I kid you not what the fuck do you think I look like a nigger? I was taken aback and just kept quite and knew what was coming the moment we got to my home. But half-way through the drive home she began to talk shit about my parents, and then that is where I had enough. So I just unloaded on her. About being a hypocrite and that Jesus taught love and maybe you could learn a thing instead of listening to your parents all the time. She slams on the breaks almost getting rear ended and tells me to get out. Which I did knowing she had a loaded gun in her glove compartment. So I did, she gets out the car and tosses all my shit I bought and the shirt I bought her on the sidewalk and says take this shit and find some nigger to give it to. At the time she was looking directly at me, I know this because after she said that her eyes got very widely big and she hopped in the car and took off. I begin to pick up my stuff and I kid you not it was like being dropped off in the middle of the so-called ghetto. There was about 5 or 6 black guys sitting on the porch watching the whole thing. I turn around and shrug and tell them what are you going to do. I gather up my shit and begin the 5 mile walk home. One of them yells hey hold up and they begin to walk up to me in a group. Now I am not racist by any chance but I was about 2 seconds away from running because I am 6 foot about 200lbs and these guys looked like line backers, and I felt like running but I just stopped out of fear. One of them asks to look in my bag which I thought ok...They just toss all my stuff around and one of them said i would not wear this shit or this shit or this shit which was all the stuff I planned on wearing. Then the biggest of the bunch picks up the shirt I bought her and says are you fucking kidding me I was going to buy this shirt for my girl but couldn't afford it. I just told him it was yours man. They offer to give me a ride back to my place and say its going to be a little while. So I walk back to their place. Well I begin to know them and everything and nicest bunch of people I have ever met in my life. But long story even longer, we smoked a bunch of pot and drank some mickey's (which I love) and stayed until night which they invited me over for a bbq. I didn't leave until about 1am but it was fun....and to be honest it was the first time I had real bbq and chitlins and it was fucking awesome.

"That I'm pretty much the reason my parents got divorced. Let me explain. When I was younger, I did not have a debit card and asked my mom to pay for a membership to a dating site (a gay one at that). She obliged because she wanted to see me happy like all mothers do. My dad wasn't happy in the marriage for various reasons, and was later diagnosed with clinical depression and received treatment for such. Well, he found the charge for the website and assumed that she was cheating on him. He even told me that he was going to divorce mom and why. At the time, it didn't occur to me that it was related to the website she paid for for me. I did not tell her that dad was going to divorce her or that it was, in part, because of said dating site. I also didn't tell my dad before he passed away (motorcycle accident). I don't think she knows why dad thought she was cheating on him, but I don't want her to know that I could have potentially staved off the divorce. Kinda makes me feel like shit.
