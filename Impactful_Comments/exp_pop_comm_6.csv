1113,"Most Poles are officially Catholic (they were baptised), but it does not mean most of them are crazy devout. It is still more conservative society than most in Western Europe, but most people attend the church only for weddings, funerals and holidays like Christmas, support and use birth control, have sex out of marriage and living together before getting married is extremely common and doesn't raise many eyebrows. We also have gay clubs and gay culture in bigger cities, although there is still a lot of prejudice against LGBT people."
1583,"There have been cases of gay couples that could not get married where one has adopted the other so that legal rights (inheritance, life/death decisions, etc.) are given to the partner. It was usually in terminal cases and I find it very sad."
655,"It's reactionary. Some people treat these cases as special because others treat it as evil and discriminate about it. Not giving a shit is the end goal, but if one party doesn't give a shit whilst the others discriminates and spreads hate, nothing is going to change. Nobody gives a shit about interracial marriage now because there isn't still a mass movement against it. When discrimination against gay or transgender people stops as well, people will stop giving a shit about stuff like that too."
1288,"Flood our (Australian) Prime Minister with letters; thanking him for filling the internet with his special brand of [explicit gay porngraphy] (http://media.tumblr.com/2e7b7de2349defe21aa74ee7d446da5e/tumblr_inline_mst7hcwlV31qz4rgp.jpg) (He is against gay marriage as it is a sin), offering him fancy yachts and cars in exchange for his ['not bad looking daugthers'] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10313055/Why-some-Australian-women-loathe-Tony-Abbott-especially-now.html) (He thought he should be voted to lead our country because of his daughters's comely appearance)"
601,I think you should tell Dan that he can't come to the wedding. He uses hate speech and clearly is sympathetic to his father's position regarding homosexuals. Your own sister is gay! How can you in good conscious marry someone like that? What if you have a child who is gay? How will his father treat him or her and allow others to treat him or her?
550,"Houston has had an openly lesbian mayor for 5 years. I live just outside of San Antonio and the only people I've heard voice an anti gay marriage opinion are old people, and they weren't even harsh about it. They're always like ""All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and we love them, like Jesus teaches, but..."""
1355,"I definitely don't see this happening as there's too much manipulation and abuse surrounding polygamy. It's typically associated with cultish behavior, there is no societal benefit to it, and you aren't ostracizing a portion of the population from state provided benefits by keeping it illegal. It'd be extremely surprising if it were to ever gain enough support to make changes like gay marriage did."
310,"There is only one correct answer. My mind did first think acceptance of gay people/gay marriage would be shocking, but I think they'd get over it. What I think they'd never understand is air travel and security. Air travel is nothing like it was in the 90s and security lines, with the removing of your shoes, not being a able to go to the cockpit, etc would seem out of some Sci Fi book."
1767,"I am in the camp who believes marriage equality is a constitutional right; thus, it cannot and should not be deferred to the states."
806,"Definitely not. We're still incredibly conservative when it comes to Same Sex Marriage, drugs, road laws, treatment of indigenous Australians, and a whole host of other things. I love it here, but we have a lot of things that we can do better."
450,Oh Libertarians can be some of the biggest hypocrites. I remember during the whole gay marriage debate so many Libertarians would twist and turn to defend their stance against gay marriage (and some still do to this day).
713,"By their own twisted logic, a straight person should have had to recuse himself as well. After all, it is their stance that gay marriage is a threat to all marriage, meaning a straight person would have had something to ""gain"" from the outcome of the case as well."
647,"and Ruth Davidson giving interviews today about the possible DUP coalition called the conservatives ""the party of gay marriage"". They voted against their own bill, but was passed by Labour and Lib Dem votes and now they want to take credit for it."
1013,"I read a post earlier about why, if same sex marriage becomes legal, why can't polygamy be legal? Why is it OK for two consenting adults of the same sex to marry, but not **more than** two consenting adults?"
290,"Oh wow, that's a good question to which I should probably have a better answer. I think people should probably change their mind about things more than they do. Especially in the US we have two major parties that take two unrelated sets of issues and the more ""partisan"" you become you are likely to have an opinion on gay marriage that correlates with your opinion on tax policy. I guess one example is I was persuaded that Democrats had a majority based on demographics, and now I think the evidence of that is less clear. Politics ebbs and flows over time."
525,I love Salt Lake City! I've been there 3 times and I will return for a 4th. I especially love it now that there's Gay Marriage in Utah. I'd totally visit.
746,"I've actually been thinking a lot about this. When asked by what authority she wasn't marrying gay people she responded ""gods authority."" Then I read that she had been married and divorced several times. But, as far as I understand it, the church does not recognize state divorce and she must have her previous marriages annulled in order for her current marriage to be valid int he eyes of the church. So - she has a state issued marriage licence for a marriage the church doesn't recognize... how is her situation different than 2 gay people getting married? Wouldn't they simply have a state issued marriage licence that the church doesn't recognize as well?"
77,"FDR and Eleanor were basically beards for each other. An intelligent and supportive wife for him, while he had several mistresses on the side. And a powerful husband for her, even though she was most likely a lesbian. They were also cousins so...I like to think that they just got married so they could be a power couple."
66,"As a Jehovah's Witness at age 12, I once engaged in a school debate where I argued against gay marriage. I look back now as a gay atheist with mixed feelings about that..."
1945,"Even if you ignore how transphobic these bills are (and how it's a reaction to how the right lost the war on gay marriage), they're totally unnecessary. Perving in bathrooms and assaulting people is already illegal no matter what gender you are, there's no need to make an extra law."
833,This. So much this. That idea plagues American conservatism so much. They beg and plead for state rights when Obama pushes for same sex marriage but will federally ban it when they are in power.
664,How can this be?? Gay marriage is legal in Canada and has been for 8 years. Canada should have been financially and socially destroyed.
541,"This is coming from the same guy who said he'd appoint judges to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges. Y'know, the one that legalized gay marriage."
379,Hillary takes a stand against gay marriage then post a meme about how people need to deal with it being legal. Bernie has pictures from the 60s of him being arrested in the name of civil rights and black protesters go against him. Wtf america
587,"It's not complicated. Religion influences politics and policy. Abortion, gay Marriage, drug legalization, on and on. The fewer people believe in that nonsense, the less the government will impose their religious bullshit on me."
866,"While I agree with the sentiment, Oreo wasn't funding any movements, while Chick-fil-a has given millions of dollars to fund anti-gay marriage movements over the last year."
1236,"Very interesting. Gay man here, so the whole legal framework of paternity is pretty unknown to me. So basically if you marry a woman you could be liable (I guess that is the correct term) for supporting any children your spouse gives birth to regardless of you being the father? I see why this maaaaay have been needed before genetic testing became commonplace, but now this needs to be reworked."
1638,"I think this will end up more of a legal matter than a social one. Right now the financial and legal benefits of being married are considerable, which is why I think our gay couples should absolutely be entitled to it. Split between three or more people...I dunno. I haven't really had time to tackle how I feel about it."
684,"Yeah I was thinking the same thing, surely a lot of people worried about conservative muslims coming in and openly opposing French liberal values, such as same sex marriage, yet here they are saying they want to ban those values."
1314,"Yeah, that's pretty much the argument I use when talking to someone who's opposed to gay marriage. Minus the ""sweet cheeks"" and bitchiness parts. That said, this happened so hard!"
649,"Ooohhhh the burn. As a Christian, I can't fucking stand this ""logic."" New Testament supercedes all Old Testament laws. There is not a damn thing in the New Testament about homosexuality. And besides that, separation of Church and State. This woman needs a lesson... If you don't want your priest/minister performing gay marriages, take it up with them. But the law doesn't exist to enforce your personal prejudices. It's meant to protect your right to practice your religion freely, not to make everyone else confirm to it."
623,Yes!! I've lived in NC for the past 25 years and FINALLY something good came of it. The last thing we did as a State was ban gay marriage. Fuck us.
1416,"We should certainly invest in future generations. But if you think mature adults can't change their opinions, how do you explain the massive shift in gay marriage over the course of about 10 years? [This news article](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/05/07/wsjnbc-poll-on-gay-marriage-2012-vs-2009-vs-2004/) documents a shift in opinion of about 20% to ""in favor"" of gay marriage. Over the course of 8 years, this is larger than the percentage of the population that can be accounted for by old people dying and young adults taking their place. So people definitely do change their views over their lifetime; most people who are racist, bigoted, or otherwise are so not because they are inherently bad people, but because they haven't been exposed to the correct kind of experience that makes them understand why their actions are wrong."
343,"As funny as that is, there are millions of gay people going through this exact thing. ""YAYYYYY!! We can get married! We're going to the courthouse tomorrow!!"" SO: ""Uh, we are?"""
1773,Can I have their job? I've been unemployed since November and these ungrateful fuckers just threw away a job? I would not only issue marriage licenses to gay couples I will even take pictures with them if they wanted. And I would smile the entire time bc I would know I just helped a couple be recognized by the gov. And Ill smile bc I finally would have a job.
823,It also [significantly reduces the suicide rate](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/22/health/teen-suicide-same-sex-marriage-study-trnd/) among LGBT teens just by existing. Studies like this are important in light of all those who would like to repeal it and make it a states' issue.
456,"He did. In part: ""I will honor your request because you are my son and I love you. I do support the democratic position on gay marriage...I hope this is a position that they really stand for and not just a political statement for votes."""
718,"I never got why so many people who are for gay marriage and are against polygamous marriages. The same argument people use for the one can be applied to the other. As far as I am concern, if you are an adult and are freely choosing to do it, you can marry whoever you want."
653,Clinton and the DNC will raise the minimum wage to $15 the same way Ted Cruz and the repubs will accept gay marriage.....with their fingers crossed behind their back.
1057,"PLOT TWIST: Her family has nothing against gays or gay marriage, they just don't think her partner's good enough for her."
389,"Well the anti-intellectuals of the right aren't convinced just yet so we better keep the ""debate"" going for another decade or two to see if we can convince Jimbo and Georgia Lee that it's real before we take any action. Sure consensus amongst scientists and the military is man-made climate change is real and a threat to the US because of global instability that will arise as 2nd and 3rd world countries suffer the consequences of climate change, but I really think we need to keep the debate going until people who lack scientific knowledge and training are convinced... otherwise we might be harming our economy by needlessly putting in those pesky small business killing, abortion inducing, gay marriage supporting, christmas hating, transgender bathroom supporting, environmental regulations that are clearly a greater enemy to the United States than ISIS and Al-Qaeda combined."
557,"Five states have legalized same sex marriage in just six months, it's quite astounding to see how fast this is moving."
797,What if the FEMA Walmart camps are actually gay marriage churches -- and anyone who gets rounded up will be forced into a gay marriage? Wake up sheeple.
91,"Husband met a guy a work, when he was leaving the guy walked up to the car and they chatted about cars a bit. Husband invited this guy (who he didnt know was gay, and didnt really care if he was) to play basketball with him. Husband tells him hes married (I called while they where chatting and heard him say its my wife) and even showed him photos of me and our kids. When he gets home, this guy who is obviously into him, starts flirting and my clueless precious husband just walks all in it LMAO. He was so embarrassed because after all that the guy responds ""I dont know what youre talking about"". This was so funny I couldnt help but share."
68,"I went to college with Anne Hathaway. She was the roommate of my best friend's girlfriend, so I was invited to the pre-party for this massive party she threw when she got paid for Princess Diaries. Honestly, it makes me very happy to say she was incredibly kind and generous. Even after she left school to pursue acting full time, I'd run into her on campus now and then (my girlfriend was a few years younger than me, so I was on campus quite a bit for a few years after graduating). Anne always said hi to me, gave me a big hug and a kiss, even though I suspect she didn't remember my name. Whatever, I wasn't going to complain. It was obvious to everyone on campus that she was *incredibly* talented. I remember friends going to see her perform a scene in a campus production of The Vagina Monologues, where she played a rape victim. They said it was probably the most moving live performance they'd ever seen, and they were amazed at her ability to cry on cue and really embody the role. To this day, I smile every time I hear about her success. She was a really lovely girl, and I think she deserves what she's achieved. It also helps that she's been openly supportive of equal marriage rights, and has generally taken advantage of her ""soapbox"" to spread a bit of goodness."
1981,"Which I don't understand. I've seen several laws passed, that I was happy passed, such as gay marriage. But never once did it come into my head ""lol conservative tears"" after those policies passed. Who has that much vitriol in their heart? Geez."
853,"Yea I don't get why everyone is freaking out. The website changed from Obama's top issues, to Trump's top issues. The same thing happened when Obama took office, the same thing will happen when someone dethrones Trump. You aren't being ignored, Climate change doesn't all of a sudden not matter, its just not Trump's Priority. Just like in 2008 Obama was against gays getting married, and look how far we have come from that. Everyone needs to take a chill pill and actually get pissed off when he himself actually does something that actually makes your life more difficult."
679,"Bin Laden died on his watch, ACA, legal weed, nationwide gay marriage. I just wish he had gotten PR and DC in as 51 and 52, as having those as part of his legacy couldn't be rewritten by revisionists in the future"
588,"More relevant to this photo is that gay marriage was a Supreme Court ruling, and flashing light on the white house does nothing to protect the rights of the LGBTQ community."
391,"not all republicans oppose gay marriage, I am a republican and believe marriage of any kind has nothing to do with politics and should not be restricted to anyone for whatever reason. can't fight hate with hate."
603,"I agree. As a gay person, I have no qualms with people who really believe gay marriage is immoral. If that's how you feel, that's how you feel. You can't just force yourself to change your ideas about morality. That's not how it works. That being said, if you let your beliefs interfere with someone else's life or someone else's pursuit of happiness, then fuck you."
937,"He also thinks that banning gay marriage constitutes equal rights, because everyone has the equal right to marry someone of the opposite sex."
1400,"I think I am going to show my support for gay marriage by watching Dr Who on Sunday. Although, given context, I think Torchwood would be more appropriate."
1686,"I never thought he was fit to be president, but I used to like Mike Huckabee. Then he offered to serve jail time for that woman who wouldn't give the gay couple a marriage license."
700,"OMG shitlord your wife is obviously malnourished. Where is her fat rolls? She is obviously starving to death. Not only are you oppressing her by having PIV rape with her, you are also conforming to the patriarchal culture that is marrying. Do you know how many homosexual, pansexuals, zoosexuals and ryangoslingsexual people out there that cannot legally marry? Check yo privilege shitllord."
1433,"Just like we learned our lesson on interracial marriages, as is the case with gay marriages. Now for all those people who say ***""Are you comparing us to the racists who wanted to prevent interracial marriages just because we want to prevent gay marriages?""*** you can stop right now because that's exactly what I'm doing. If you're against gay marriage, you're as bad as the racists were back then."
656,"I read the Facebook comments on this on the Fox News Facebook page and I didn't know whether or not to laugh or cry. People actually think that this is the end of the world. One person said that ""the Supreme Court has just pushed whatever is left of our republic directly to hell"". You've GOT to be kidding me. How can people claiming they're Christian be so hateful? I'm a right-leaning libertarian Christian, and I somehow have managed to not think gay marriage is the end of the nation, why can't everyone else?"
766,"It's hilarious, actually. Trump takes three positions on abortion over the course of 12 hours? Nobody cares. Clinton shifts from supporting civil unions to supporting gay marriage over the course of two decades? Clearly she's a pandering shill."
1432,"This is not actually *just* about that. If you actually are paying attention to the coverage, his refusal to perform marriages is not mentioned in the actual investigation. Him screening out same sex couples *prior to* stopping performing marriages all together is mentioned but so are about 4 other ethics complaints including providing false statements in previous complaint investigations and allowing a felon to handle firearms. And the investigation isn't so much about the legality of his actions as it is about whether he has violated the ethics of his office."
363,"I think it's time we ask Barack Obama to allow lesbians to own other vehicles besides the Subaru Forester. If gays can get married, lesbians should be able to buy an F150 like the rest of us."
1875,You beat us to gay marriage. I have no doubt that you will. Meanwhile the government here can't even talk about gay marriage without saying they have to conduct a national vote on the issue.
829,I'm 5'1 and male. Genetics made me short and gay. I married a 6'4 foot giant. We can't 69 because of our height difference. Besides that we learn to work around the height difference.

725,""" This is all because we let the gays marry.....marriage is no longer sacred....Obama.....ISIS....build a wall.... so can we really blame O'Reilly?"" ~ Right wing logic explanation."
836,"You know, it's less about the president this election and more about the supreme court, house and senate. You saying ""I'm a minority and I still hate Hillary!"" is going to get a lot of approval from the demographic on this site but voting for president goes beyond what you seem to think. You're hurting all those groups you say you don't hate. You voted in a VP that made gay marriage illegal (as in you get jail time for applying for a marriage license). I don't particularly like Clinton either, but none of this is in a vacuum."
1080,"Everyone's gonna say that it's dumb that he only cares if his own kid is affected, and as long as it's someone else's kid it doesn't matter to him. I sympathize with that viewpoint...but at the same time, sometimes you gotta just take yes for an answer. Hopefully he can convince some of his colleagues, and say ""look, I have a gay kid and it changed my mind. If you had a gay kid it would change yours...but it shouldn't matter about your kids. If you'd support gay marriage if you had a gay kid, you should support it now."""
477,"I think it's just because in the last year or two, the GOP has realized they've basically lost the same-sex marriage (or as we now call it: marriage) argument and they needed another wedge issue to get their base riled up. Unfortunately, because of the trans community's small size and the preexisting stigma against them, they were an easy target to rile up most Republicans and even a dismaying number of people throughout the left."
590,"We live in rural Germany, in a small town, which adds to my believe that the recent legislation of gay marriage are the reason my son came out."
817,"Man, I'm not even gay but even I want to apply for a marriage license with a dude just to egg her on."

Maybe I couldn't find it, anyone got a source on that?"
856,"It would be a great idea for the Obama administration to support it. Right now he is working to define his legacy. Bin Laden is a key thing, but that excitement has since passed. Legalizing gay marriage (even though that wasn't him they jumped on that wagon immediately) and legalizing marijuana would certainly be remembered."
749,"Sweet, sweet irony. I hope the people that pushed for the ban realize that they ultimately helped legalize same sex marriage."
620,"Why would evangelicals care about morals or ethics? Trump promised to deliver them Supreme Court justices that will turn back the clock on Roe v Wade and gay marriage. As long as Trump panders to them, they couldn't care less. He is a ""baby Christian"" after all."
392,"Seriously, why is everyone hyping Colorado so hard when Washington did the same thing? We also legalized gay marriage at the same time!"
631,"Our support for marriage equality isn't about denying people who disagree an opportunity to voice their opinion. We support equality because we believe it is the right thing to do. As a company, we value all of our employees and taking stances like this make it clear that everyone is welcome. People who disagree can still voice there opinion. But it is important to us that we use our voice to stand up for what we believe in. And we believe in equality."

And the West hardly gives a shit, because they are our ""ally"". It's amazing how much shit you can get away with if you have a lot of oil. The West needs to make very serious work of energy independence so these people don't have leverage over us."
1532,"They're a religious company and they're even closed on Sundays. For some reason, it doesn't really surprise me that they're against gay marriage."
659,"You will find a similar reversal on the subject of gay marriage. I think most people have come to the conclusion that both are harmless, neither affects my life and both make other people happy. Let them be."
813,But wasn't Hillary against gay people almost her entire career? And I've heard Trump was for gay marriage a decade ago? Just... writing what I heard.
1445,Alabama seems to be on the wrong side of history quite often. You know when SCOTUS approved same-sex marriage many of the courthouses in Alabama just closed their doors so they wouldn't have to issue any licenses.
365,"You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married."
1884,"No, but if they tried we could applaud that person for making the strait state recognize gay marriage as a marriage."
851,"Maybe they were ok with gay marriage even before Obama, but were afraid/pressured to not express it. When Obama expressed his support they finally felt comfortable to express their own support."
519,"This fucking rapist has the enthusiastic endorsement of the vast majority of the ""gay marriage will lead to the destruction of traditional marriage!"" crowd."
881,"The opposite of that argument was heavily used to argue against gay marriage. They were saying it's a slippery slope. They said if gay people can get married next thing you know, people are marrying objects, ideas etc. Guess they were extremely wrong."
842,Both of Obama's appointees ruled in favor of marriage equality. A GOP president would likely have meant that the decision went the other way.

509,"Didn't Trump win more of the Hispanic vote than Romney did? If the Left keeps on insisting on viewing everything through the prism of identity politics they're going to start losing minority voters, many of whom aren't fully on board with their views on gender, race, and Islam. Hell, even my Hispanic father cared less about his immigration stance than about his connections with Russia, and my traditional Hispanic mother has serious issues with gay marriage and abortion. The concept of a rainbow coalition is a flawed one when many of those same people have social views that are antithetical to those of coastal Leftists."

In 2000, you know who was against gay marriage, Hillary Rodham Clinton."
99,He turned out to be gay. He's now married and has three adopted children. He's a really nice guy now. Trying to hide who you really are puts a lot of pressure on a teenager.

404,"As Pro LGBTQ+ as I am, I'm having a tough time with my sibling who is gay and whenever I try and hang out with him he always has to be gay first and everything else second. I offer to take us to a concert for The Weeknd and he says ""oh no he's too ugly, let's go see Justin Bieber he's so fine I'd suck his dick on stage"" or if a JB song plays on the radio he shrieks and starts going on about how he wants to marry him and be his sugar baby. ""Hey wanna go to the gym?"" ""Yaaasssssss queeeennnnn, I wanna see myself some future ex husbands"". I ask him what he likes to do for fun and he says being gay.

187,"I understand where you're coming from, but I would just like to point out that Bill Clinton, despite being an establishment centrist, appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg who has done a phenomenal job. The next president will very likely either shift the balance of the court to the left, or solidify the right's hold on it. If another Scalia is appointed, all those 5-4 decisions that hinged on a conservative justice having some moderate views won't be happening anymore. Gay marriage would still be illegal if the court leaned a little further right. I don't much care for Clinton either but SCOTUS appointments are just too important for me to ignore."
93,"If only more people did your 180! When the SCOTUS ruled in favor of gay marriage, I have a bigot brother in law who started posting awful shit on FB and I just replied on a few different posts saying ""if you don't like gay marriage don't marry a dude, problem solved but don't be an asshole to those who this directly affects.""
