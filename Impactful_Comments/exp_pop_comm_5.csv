1968,"Conservatives tend to try and champion institutions, religion, and ""family values"". Comedy by its very nature seeks to deconstruct and mock these institutions. This goes back centuries. It also aligns more closely today with progressive values such as atheism, gay marriage, and anti-corporate ideologies. So yes, it is actually harder for conservatives to be funny and their comedy comes off more partisan and contrived."
982,So if I'm understanding this correctly... the ones that were actively against gay marriage actually ended up helping the cause by creating these bans? Ain't that ironic.
1216,"Sure! I support marriage equality -- in short, government should stay out of the bedroom. And I am a strong defender of the Second Amendment -- it's super clear and simple ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"""
589,"It's so frustrating seeing LGBT issues condensed down to gay marriage alone. Especially now that the SCOTUS has weighed in. He fought against his state providing any sort of care for HIV and brought the fatality rate for HIV to levels closer to Rwanda than his neighboring states. But no, of course this is not worth mentioning."
1076,Taiwan is legalizing gay marriage. China claims Taiwan is a part of China. Therefore China is legalizing gay marriage. Yay! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
497,All six Muslim MPs in UK Parliament voted in favour of gay marriage. Wonder how the Daily Mail bible-bashers will react to a lesson in tolerance from the world of Islam?
402,"It's also amazing that Apple hired Ted Olson, he is an incredibly gifted lawyer. He successfully argued Bush v. Gore and Perry v. Schwarzenegger. The first case being the case that officially settled the 2000 Presidential election, the second being the case that invalidated Prop 8 and led to the legalization of gay marriage in California. There aren't many legal minds out there today who are more respected and have had more of an impact on the legal world."
781,There is a referendum on gay marriage coming up so the pamphlets are being used as part of the no campaign.
252,Preventing same-sex marriage. I get that people can be uncomfortable with the idea but spouting that a same sex couple would ruin the sanctity of marriage is bullshit. Last I checked Marriage is about commitment and when you have things like Vegas/shotgun weddings you can't really argue about a same sex couple that are in love getting married.
1604,I'm okay with people in one state not being able to get married for a year if it means the other 49 states and federal government will have marriage equality be secured as a constitutional right.
1684,So they legalized gay marriage but you don't get to choose WHO you marry because then you could just choose to marry someone of the opposite sex and be straight? Flawless.
661,"Black woman under sixty here. I think Jesse Jackson is ridiculous and a terrible face for the black community, and the only ounce of respect I ever felt for him was when I heard him speak in favor of gay marriage. Considering how the black community as a whole feels about that topic, it was good to hear one of its more visible members rise above the hate and say something positive about it."
359,MLK Jr. didn’t support gay marriage. So if you only oppose gay marriage but support equality in races then he can be your profile picture.
552,"The proper response to them being anti gay marriage and anti marijuana is ""Why do you people hate freedom? You know who also hates the freedom of gay marriage? ISIS."" That should lead to a proper Christmas argument."
625,They probably would if that person was being elected to a high office and had publicly stated their opinions against gay marriage.
846,"That is now my attitude on gay marriage: ""Hey I'm goin up to play ping pong now, you can play if you want to."""
224,"It really does! This needs to be talked about every single day. I feel like this entire election, healthcare reform, gay marriage, and every other political and social problem is just a smoke screen for the real issue. **JERKY IS TOO EXPENSIVE!**"
1959,"It's ironic to hear from thrice-divorced, no children Rush Limbaugh that gay people are ruining the sanctity of marriage and procreation is the purpose of marriage."
409,"Hey think of it this way, you'll be the first country in your continent to pass gay marriage laws whenever it does happen"
1344,I would argue that they're not so much opposing same-sex marriage as voicing irritation with the lack of political representation that trans-people get (but they made the point awfully)
489,"It's a great start, and it makes gay couples MUCH more equal to straight couples in the eyes of the law. Nobody's asking to have the Catholic Church agree to marry two gay men, we just want them to have the same legal rights as straight couples."
69,I thought my mom was a lesbian until I was 15 and found her jurnals on the family computer turns out she married my mama just to pissed off my grandfather.
58,"Went to a kinky elf party once for Christmas, good mix of a crowd until we all got shit-faced. Some guy got dared to be blind folded and get blown by some random girl. Guy at the party who had always denied being gay, decided it would be funny to blow him. That's how my friends tom and Chad met and got married."
1316,"The left isn't insisting on politizing gay marriage and trans bathroom bills. Look at DOMA and NC's HB 2. Weed banning, ""voter ID"" laws, Republicans propose bills to fabricated problems."
675,"Let's not forget that issues like marriage equality, unarmed blacks asking police not to shoot them and the war on Christmas are oppressing him."
1882,"I know I know, but Ireland is more there to bring home the point that every Native-English speaking nation has legalised same-sex marriage except Australia."
614,"A cat owner who doesn't *already* have cat pictures on the internet? Yeah, sure. And that senator pressing the anti gay marriage agenda is totally straight too."
407,"I didn't have room to share the other amazing fact from this story: they took their case to court but they were dismissed. The judge who ruled against them was, no joke, Anthony Kennedy, who later joined the Supreme Court and last month cast the deciding vote to LEGALIZE gay marriage."
255,"You have no idea how it is for moderate conservatives, at least these assholes don't have a real voice in elections. All I want is to be left alone by the government. Do we need taxes, roads, education, police, and fire? yes, I'll pay taxes for those now stop butting into my life. I don't care if gays marry or not, we should just let them, the government shouldn't have any say in that, same deal for abortion, I don't want the government telling me what I can and cannot do to my own damn body. If I want to get high or not wear a helmet on my motorcycle fucking let me be dumb as fuck."
349,"He has no ambivalence on issues such as abortion, but he is marketed to the public to have ambivalence. He, just like any other abiding Catholic, is against abortion, same sex marriage, etc. Francis, however, unlike previous popes, does not feel it is the Catholic Church's duty to impose its beliefs on others and that the Church should focus on its more basic and loving principles. That, in my opinion, still deserves quite a bit of respect."
640,"Meanwhile, here in the US, taking away gay people's right to marriage is literally a part of the GOP platform, and Dear Leader just signed an executive order allowing federal contractors to fire gay people for being gay."
986,"According to this source it was [38 years](http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/06/a-historic-day-in-dallas-throughout-state-as-supreme-court-oks-same-sex-marriage.html/). They said they had confidence it would happen someday. I personally wouldn't have believed it, but their optimism certainly panned out."
1260,Problem is there are over a thousand federal marriage benefits. And not all are financial. Marriage is very much important and necessary today. There's a reason gay people want it. It's not just a matter of love or equality. Marriage is about many things and I think it is naive to assume it's just a matter of the government recognizing my relationship. As someone who used to be anti marriage I changed my tune once I found out what marriage actually means outside of a Disney movie.
591,"While I have not problem with gay marriage and adoption, I really hate when people use kids for political messaging. Things like this or when they have children holding signs on a protest for whatever the parents cause happens to be. And I see this gets the message across, is very cute and sad but the principle of using kids for your political messaging is a bugbear to me."
1171,it's the real reason and the reason I understand the least. It's not like legalizing gay marriage makes gay marriage mandatory.
516,Why are people so surprised about them being opposed to same sex marriage? This is the company that is closed on Sundays (literally) for Christ's sake.
442,"In some placed denying a gay person service would boost business, Portland is not one of them. It's probably one of the worst seeing how it's so liberal. I remember when the CEO of Chic fil A said he didn't agree with gay marriage and for the next week they has three times as much business, at least in the south."
887,"Yeah, a lot of people seem to be operating from the belief that gay marriage is *so unnatural* that kids will be absolutely *wrecked* if the concept is explained to them, but in actuality kids are unlikely to have the programming at such a young age to even know why the topic is so controversial, unless they've been instilled with it."
262,"Some based gay couple looking to marry should go to muslim bakery, ask for wedding cake and throw a lawsuit if they don't."
1695,"Mr. Trump. I know you've said that things like gay marriage and marijuana are states issues. Would you overturn gay marriage laws and leave it on a per-state basis? Would you remove marijuana from schedule I and leave that to states as well, much like alcohol is?"
1704,That two people of the same sex that are in love can't get married in some countries yet two people of the opposite sex can marry and divorce within hours
714,"I like the fact that most of the time the show completely lets you forget that he's gay, and it only comes up the same way any other marriage or relationship would come up. There are a few storylines here and there where it comes into focus, but almost no jokes, no obvious mannerisms. It's one of many character traits that he has, and it's totally normalized."
394,"Or you could say he didn't have the balls to lead. He claimed to publicly support gay marriage at the time but when the bill came across his desk he vetoed it, pissing a lot of people off."
579,"Ah Dubai, the land of clear pools, beautiful beaches and prisons for homosexuals. Where you can see the pinnacle of human engineering and be killed for being an atheist. Where you can rape and get on a plane home, and where you can be raped and sent to jail for having sex outside of marriage."
630,"There is no such thing as a spoiler. Anyone who tells you that is a fear-mongering tool of the establishment. If a candidate does not win (in a fair election, which it's not, but let's pretend it is), they did not get enough votes in the right places in order to win, period. No one is entitled to anyone's vote, period. That's how the system works. The two parties have control over the system. If they are not happy about it, they can change it. You have the complete right to vote for a third party, even though the two parties and the media have created obstacles and campaigns against doing so. The Democratic party has spread lies about its supposed progressive agenda, meanwhile the only things they ever put any real effort behind are pro-corporate centrist policies that align more with moderate Republicans and moderate independents than they do with progressives. The party will continue to shift to the right on nearly everything, except a few social wedge issues (guns, abortion, marriage equality) in order to guilt you into voting for them in order to stop the Republicans. They'll do it because they can, and because you'll let them. They even had the gall to start a movement called ""Blue No Matter Who"" which is perhaps the most ignorant slogan a political party could come up with. Why would you vote blindly for a party regardless of its nominee? You should vote for whoever you want to, not who you're told to. People will try to shame you, bring up Nader as an excuse for their own loss and failure to capture enough of the electorate, scare you into believing Trump will destroy the world, accuse you of not being a true progressive because you aren't voting based on Supreme Court nominations, or simply tell you to grow up because voting for who you want is apparently what you do when you're young and naive. Yet the last several decades of elections have produced almost nothing for the progressive cause, despite the supposedly effective tactic of voting blue no matter who. The Democratic party will never change if you keep voting for it and it keeps ignoring you the day after Election Day. Apparently, third party voters are supposed to ""learn a lesson"" or so I've been told, yet the Democratic party can do whatever it wants, nominate the most corrupt candidate in perhaps the history of politics, and you're expected to fall in line. That's not democracy. If the few people who refuse to vote for Hillary are the ones who will decide the election, they are the ones the party should listen to and evolve towards, and not just for show. Otherwise, they can find voters elsewhere. Don't be a prisoner to the system. Take in all the information you can, and vote for whoever you want."
873,"I see where you're coming from, but I think even that would fall under the ""piss poor"" umbrella. Homosexual couples *can* have children, through adoption or if they have an egg donor. Furthermore, there are separate tax breaks for having kids, so I don't think that people who marry and don't have kids are really reaping benefits not meant for them anyway."
266,"Dude sounds like a damn internet troll. The debate on both things is over- climate change is happening and humans are making it happen, and gay marriage does not destroy nations. Canada has enjoyed nationwide marriage equality for about 10 years now and so far no apocalypse."
1967,How would gay marriage even come up in that conversation? Did the service person ask the customer about their opinion on gay marriage?
415,Even further plot twist: the bride who had to marry a transgender woman and who was a lesbian in the first place has 1 year to live
1777,"Bye bye, Roe! You too, Wade. Farewell, same sex marriage. Sayonara, action on climate change, or should I say CHINA HOAX? Helloooo conservative supreme court supermajority for the next half century! Well done, America!"
609,"What about civil unions for all? Do you think it would help if, as far as the government were concerned, all marriages--gay or straight--were, officially, ""civil unions?"""
71,"This story is Fox News' wet dream. A gay man, married to another man, gets stoned and kills his foster child by forgetting that he left her in a hot car, and only realizes it when watching a TV show full of nudity, foul language, and homosexuality. This will trumpeted in every piece of conservative literature for years to come."
59,"I'm in a fantastic, committed, loving relationship for the first time in my life, but I can't share that news with anyone because my parents are so heavily against sex before marriage for religious reasons that they would be on my case before I got the word ""boyfriend"" out of my mouth. Doesn't help that it's a same-sex relationship."
1529,No it is an example of what happens when your populous is poor and I'll educated. Country's such as the UK aren't majority gay but they are passing same sex marriage bills rather than banning it.
727,"Brought gay marriage legalization, killed osama bin laden, economy is improving, gitmo has many less prisoners, Obamacare provided insurance for 20 million people. He wasn't perfect, but you can't ignore all the good he did as well."
621,"I'm gonna go with polygamy. There's already a few cases working their way through the courts. It's like interracial or gay marriage - the participants want it, why not let them?"
417,SCOTUS. The biggest impact the next president will have is on the next 30 of the Supreme Court. Citizens United. Healthcare. Net Neutrality. Gay Marriage. LGBT rights. All of this will be decided in SCOTUS.
278,Super religious 67 year old man from the back woods of Louisiana. How did anyone think he would be pro gay marriage. I mean come on.
461,"Wow, awesome to see the flipside. Religious people using the freedom of religion to attack the standard view point that the government should step down on same-sex marriage in the name of religion."
668,"For those who aren't aware, Orson Scott Card is publicly and vehemently against such civil rights issues as the rights of gays to marry. Not that it makes his writing worse, but still pretty lame."
1023,The Atlantic had a big article about the prevalence of homosexual activity in [Saudi Arabia](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/the-kingdom-in-the-closet/305774/) because women are absolutely taboo until marriage.
1300,A church has every right to hate gay marriage and not condone it. The government on the other hand has no right to stop two adults from getting all the advantages of marriage.
608,"The gay club in this area hates bachelorette parties. Not only are they obnoxious, but it also kind of rubs in the fact that most of the people in the establishment can't get married to the person they'd like to be with..."
1238,"I'm for gay marriage, I'm pro choice, I hate the patriot act, and I'm for gun rights. I'm pretty much screwed either way."
540,"All nations are going down! CAN YOU READ?! Our Lord Jesus Christ tied that same-sex marriage action to His return in power and glory to execute judgment on them that know not God and that OBEY not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christ: CAN YOU READ?! I told you one man, one woman, one lifetime. I may have made his words to be more like your speech, but his content was EXACTLY that! Do not be so painfully Bible dumb please!"
473,"Count your blessings. We just got [a new one](https://nltimes.nl/2017/07/26/new-us-ambassador-hoekstra-gay-marriage-abortion) in the Netherlands that is against abortion and same sex marriage. He was born here, but moved to the US when he was three years old, in 1957. So now he's coming back home, and he's bringing the fifties."
955,"This is where the lies that say both parties are the same go to die. You can try and mask it with a million comparisons, but when it comes to issues like these, there's no contest. I remember in 2004 when Republicans stoked the flames and put gay marriage issues on the ballot, state by state, to try to drum up support against gays for votes in the general election. It was a rallying cry. Obama endorsed gay marriage before he was even reelected in 2012, less than 9 years later. This animosity and thinly-veiled bigotry will now die in a corner, as it rightly should. The Supreme Court won't go against this, which is made clear by their mere posturing if nothing else. The only sadness I have in all this is knowing that the gay and lesbian community will continue to face a lack of acceptance for decades if not centuries in the court of public opinion. This has been made clear to me by the present sexism and racism that still exists today, which is a sad tale itself. I'm straight and love women, but it's not my business to get into other people's personal lives, and I think this will become the civil-rights victory of our age."
267,People like this dude and the couple that vowed divorce if gay marriage was legalized need to understand gay marriage is going to happen anyway and that its not going to destroy the world.
1721,I'm sure it won't take long for someone to link this to the judge overturning the ban on same-sex marriage in Utah.
1963,"For me the music video served as a juxtaposition of an arguably disgusting yet acceptable form of heterosexual ""love"" in the spring breakers, and a perfectly civilized yet unaccepted form of love in gay marriage."
736,"I agree with you. (I remember him going way off FOX script during Katrina) However, there has been a shift at Fox over this Kim Davis situation. I've seen a lot of criticism of her (a lot for Fox). Maybe they are abandoning ship on marriage equality."
396,You also have to be pretty committed to your beliefs on the other side to pass on a delicious chicken sandwich. I support marriage equality but I support feeding myself delicious chicken just that much more.
636,"If you can pass the requirements and training to serve then what is going on between your legs is irrelevant. In Canada we've allowed it since 1992 and, much like with all the other imaginary slippery slope fallacies that don't come true, everything turned out fine. Allowing women to vote didn't break anything. Gay marriage didn't ruin marriage. Transgender troops won't weaken the military. Anyone that says otherwise is just an asshole, or dealing with some personal insecurities, or both."
632,"You'd be amazed how common it is in the black community. Remember that california vote, where everyone turned up to vote for Obama, and also voted against gay marriage?"
956,"""Marriage is an important part of getting ahead in life. People see a ring and they know he's not a homo, at least one person can stand him, his dick works, and he must have some cash"""
275,"Seems like this Pope is on the right side of many issues: Palestine, Climate Change, US/Cuba Relations, poverty reduction, etc. We just need to get him on board with gay marriage and I'd be very pleased indeed."
1980,"Genuine question, please don't ban me, although I'm expecting the downvotes. How does this coincide with his list of ~20 potential Supreme Court nominations, all of whom have vowed to repeal the same sex marriage act? I've been curious about this since originally viewing him holding the flag. Thank you very much"
503,"Huh. I was surprised to see PA was blue. I completely forgot that we legalized same sex marriage earlier this year. It's almost as if same-sex marriage doesn't affect me, a heterosexual man, in the slightest fucking bit. Imagine that."
678,"Getting a divorce from an interracial gay marriage, the getting remarried to someone of a different religion after you both had a sex change, in a non religious ceremony, then adopting a child who identfies as the opposite sex, then having an abortion."
72,"Newt Gingrich wants to ""preserve"" the sanctity of marriage by not allowing gays to get married. The man who's gotten a divorce two different times and cheated on his wife who has cancer wants to preserve the sanctity of marriage. DaFuq."
61,Well I kissed my male best friend when I was 5...... and the second job I had was working construction for that same friend's dad when I was 17.... so I'm a gay construction worker who married his bosses son......
1668,"Exactly. If your history class didn't need to memorize when interracial marriage was passed (mine didn't), they probably won't need you to memorize when gay marriage was passed."
759,"Yeah, I give him credit for what he's done, given the circumstances. He's had to move rightward on a ton of shit just to work with Congress. At the end of the day, I don't think we would have been making progress on gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and relations with Cuba if we had a Republican president. I also think thee situation with Iran would be much worse..."
633,Conservatives warned us this would happen if gay marriage were legal. Two bears marrying each other! What is the world coming to?!
485,You missed one step: a Parliamentary committee voted to scrap the citizen's initiative and not allow marriage equality. Today's vote was bypassing the committee.
348,"Why is butt sex always ok their mind if they don't like it? Come one. Not even people who like butt stuff spend so much time thinking about butt stuff. Homophobes think that's all gay folk do, butt stuff. No romance, marriage, bills, etc. Truth is gay marriage is just as boring as straight marriage and no one thinks about butt stuff more than homobophes."
496,"Mayor preventing Chick fil a here. Their opinion about gay marriage isnt the exact same as mine, so Im going to prevent them from expanding a legitimate buisiness based on my opinion. AMA about my tolerance"
755,"Hillary, don't you dare talk about LGBT rights as if you didn't speak about the traditional definition of marriage not too long ago"
1109,"This might sound off the wall, but is there any possibility he might be gay and just repressing it? It seems like a good way to set up a relationship to look straight but not have to have any physical contact. I would be very concerned that ""until marriage"" would turn into ""Im just not ready yet…"" for years until you find him texting other dudes wanting to kiss their penises."
1569,"This would be inserted into the Constitution, making same-sex marriage a constitutional *right*, not merely a legal possibility. Future governments would not have the option of rescinding marriage equality without the permission of the People in another referendum."
613,"I sure you're not the first one to leave this movie with this feeling, and you won't be the last. The answer is......Hey look over there, women want to control thier own bodies, gays want to marry, they're trying to take the word ""God"" off our money,....."
1267,I hate this argument. You're against gay marriage? Congrats. You want me to respect that? Nah. Respect me as a person first.
555,"They consider their president, a rapey thrice married adulterer, as a goodly christian man deserving of their prayers yet selling a cake to a gay person is offensive to them. They have really exposed themselves as the shameless hypocrites that I always knew they were."
526,"My hometown...which strangely enough a few months ago was already preparing the paperwork to issue same-sex marriage licenses when and if a verdict for its favor was received. Surprised the hell out of me, and i'm gay!"
1062,Can we just take a moment to reflect on how awesome it is that an *independently produced* album that contains an [incredibly moving and eloquent case for marriage equality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0) is currently #1 on iTunes?
294,"She doesn't need to be fired, she can just be transferred. I bet the dude that cleans the toilets would be happy to marry a gay couple. They could switch jobs."
1742,"This is a double edged bill. It protects whichever decision a state makes and the federal courts cannot overturn them. So say a state makes gay marriage legal, the federal court can't do anything about it. However, the reverse is true as well. Ultimately a states rights boost but could go any which way based on the individual states. The libertarian in me likes it but the social liberal in me worries about the decisions some of the states may make."
760,My ex was always concerned with that she had a legitimate fear that when we got married (we were engaged at one point) that I would leave here in like 10 years for a dude. I'm still not quite sure how to feel about it. I will say that I could totally get why people think I'm gay cause I'm very secure in my sexuality. Totally not attracted to dudes but I can appreciate a well sculpted body.
449,"While I recognize and support politicians who's values ""change"" and they go from not supporting issues such as gay marriage to now supporting it, as at least they aren't STILL objecting it.. There's something to stay about a politician who has been fighting for the right side of history all along. That's the kind of person we want in office, not one who realizes decades later they were wrong."
674,I honestly can't think of a legal debate for not allowing gays to marry. To me it's just sad to see these bigots grasping at reasons to justify marginalizing a group of people.
553,I wonder how long until the Libs use this to make it sound like labor opposes same sex marriage. I'm guessing less than a week.
938,"She couldn't have actually married the Eiffel Tower, because she keeps referring to it as a ""she"" and same-sex marriage is not legal in France."
1657,"It's pretty much the definition of a reasonable compromise. Gay people get to be married and religious clerks don't have to officially support it. You don't want *any* compromise, which is fine, but in terms of compromises this is a fair one."
1632,"I think my favourite progressive redneck meme is the ""I don't care about gay marriage because thinking of what 2 faggots do with their dicks is about the gayest thing y can do."""
240,"I'm fine if you're against gay marriage, just don't use a book, in which you've ignored 90% of the other ""rules"" contained in it, as your argument."
279,"Its like they're so focused on the persecution for her lack of choice regarding gay marriage and her religious views, that they totally forget she has a choice to quit her job. I'm pretty sure the party line for Christians is if your job causes you to sin, find a new job. She wouldn't be pulling this shit at a strip club refusing to take off her clothes, she'd leave. But here she is, refusing to leave the job that requires her to sin, which tells me she values a paycheck and benefits more than her religion."
179,"This week has seen the United States legalise gay marriage, 3 terrorist attacks within a day (+ one in Syria?) and Greece nearing default. May as well end the week with a Russian offensive for good measure!"
124,"How about ""Is it true that you are the manifestation of God's wrath, here to bring low society for turning their back on morals, and welcoming depravity with open arms by allowing the gays to get married?"""
350,"This gets said a lot but seeing as the primary reasons for fighting homosexuality seem to be religious ones, a lot of us consider ourselves allies in the battle for gay equality. I'm a married woman but I speak up when I hear the people in my area/family pushing homophobic propaganda. Add to that, there's only so many ways to discuss how God isn't real. At some point, this also becomes a subreddit for us to simply discuss common interests. Gay equality seems to be one of them and that's fine, I think. Lots of people who aren't gay want to see gays treated like normal folks. Judging by the numbers of posts here that deal with homosexuality, a good few of those are atheists."
5,"HA! I've also heard someone in the family say something similar. ""You'll have to be gay to get married, that's the only kinda marriage they want now!"""
1773,Can I have their job? I've been unemployed since November and these ungrateful fuckers just threw away a job? I would not only issue marriage licenses to gay couples I will even take pictures with them if they wanted. And I would smile the entire time bc I would know I just helped a couple be recognized by the gov. And Ill smile bc I finally would have a job.
564,"I think you're trying to reclaim the word ""conservative"" with its older meaning, and rightfully so. But in 2012, ""conservative republicans"" are pro big government war spending, pro big government Israel spending, pro big government regulations when it applies to women's health care regulations, gay marriage, and Christian religious laws, etc. And most of the rhetoric from conservatives supports this. I welcome a sensible return to a Conservative party that doesn't consist solely of Christian Right warriors, but it's wishful thinking to say that ""REAL conservatives"" are different, because I just don't see them anywhere."
799,"I'm not even American, but I've lived in America for a few years now and it bothers me. The people are actually pretty far away from the stereotypes of gun-toting and racist rednecks even in places like Kentucky. I see a lot of Europeans complaining about things like racism in the US, but in Japan we're more racist against Koreans and other foreigners and Europe did have the Holocaust... The Europeans also complain about gay rights in the US but only 4 European countries allow gay marriages, more states in the US allow it. They complain about Americans being fat, but that shouldn't even bother them. The only legitimate complaint I hear is that America is the world police. I get a little sick of America sailing their ships through our harbors and not letting us have an army, but that's the American government, not the American people."
1228,"Soon, anyone who isn't having married heterosexual sex in the missionary position under the covers with the lights off is going to identify as ""queer."""
97,"Goodbye, Rick. As much as I find you repellent, hypocritical, hateful, and sometimes outright dishonest, I don't wish you any harm. May many happily married gay couples hug you whenever you turn up in public."
468,"I never really researched the issue, so I thought that there had always been bans on gay marriage and such. This gif just blew my mind."
499,"how is gay marriage even a legal issue? it blows my mind. if two (or more, i guess) people want to marry, no institution should be able to stop them from marrying. regardless of sexual orientation, or any factor for that matter. its silliness. the illegality of gay marriage is as mental as racially segregated washrooms in my opinion, what a joke. too bad google and oreo dont team up and start a campaign to expose the retardation of government. would be a little more risky for business than jumping on the double-stuffed-rainbow bandwagon i suppose"
199,"It feels like Bernie is one of the only politicians that gets any media coverage that is openly saying ""Corruption is rampant in Washington"", ""Gay marriage should be legal"", ""Marijuana should be legal"", ""Corporations are the driving force behind fuckhead politicians."" So many politicians receive a $10,000+ check and vote in favor of lower standards for citizens. Lower standards for health, for rights, for accountability, for transparency, for freedoms. These fuckheads are voting with the dollar, and Bernie seems to be a loud voice over the nonsense. If he gets elected I think President Sanders will be a name that will be remembered. I will vote for him. In my phone's calendar I have put, on November 1st, ""Voting day November 3rd."", on November 2nd I've put, ""Vote tomorrow you asshole"" and on November 3rd, I've put ""Vote today you lazy complacent shithead."" Sanders and Elizabeth Warren feel like the only people who aren't shoveling obvious shit-covered lies into my ears."
1499,"Many nations today still have slavery, widespread genocide, and zero rights for women. I don't think anyone in those countries is going to be feeling too awkward about marriage equality for a very long time."
1788,"The great thing about liberal gun-owners is we care about the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th. Its the GOP that worries about the 2nd while defending torture and fearing gay people having access to marriage certificates."
