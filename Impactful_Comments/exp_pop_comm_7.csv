1424,"Maybe I'll get downvoted for this, but good on them. Most businesses support marriage equality by putting their logo on a rainbow flag or producing merch for Pride once a year. They could potentially lose revenue for this and they're still pushing the issue and encouraging people to support the cause through proper channels, legislation."
1708,"I never understood the ""let the churches deal with it, not the government"". There's all kinds of things that you need a marriage license for: tax exemptions, visitation rights, custody rights, child support, etc, etc, etc. Plus, the govt is so far into marriage licensing now, they might as well just let gays/lesbians marry."
734,"Winning by popular vote literally means a majority of humanity (in that location) wanted gay marriage legalized. What kind of logic is that. ""Well, humanity got what it wanted, most people are happy, I guess humanity is screwed."""
1596,She also allowed a conscience vote on gay marriage. She just said she was personally against it because she's against all marriage.
693,I get PMs all the time telling me I'm a racist bigot for criticizing Islam. I'll go a step further. Islam is a cancer. It should be outlawed world wide. Anyone who practices it should be sent to prison for life. Mohammed married a 6 year old and Muslims defend him by claiming he didn't fuck her until she was 9. Islam is a cancer. Goat fucking towel heads. Liberals think there is an issue with Christians denying service to gay people but flat out ignore the culture of violence and rape that is Islam. Women are treated like dog shit in Islam. Men marry child brides. They legit fuck goats. What is PETA's stance on that? Liberalism is a severe mental disorder.
869,"Pretty sure this is like the third time reddit has said we've legalised same sex marriage, when in actual fact the bill just passed through a significant stage each time"
1473,"And the thing about Obama is that when he changes his views (for example, gay marriage) he takes the time to explain how he arrived to the change of heart. I'm not sure Romney has ever given legitimate reasons for his flip flopping."
373,"As a proud Oregonian, we'll let you get gay married, smoke a bowl, AND shoot guns! At the same time! Woooo, go Beaver State!"
858,"Man. Heard your speech at a [8]. I never even really cared much about what happened with gay marriage, always kind of thought ""meh, whatever. No big deal, it's not hurting anyone."" The last line really got me. I never just thought of it as strictly sexual preference. If I wasn't allowed to marry who I loved because of that... I'd be miserable. Thanks for opening my eyes. You're such an honest person, you're clearly intelligent, and hell... I wish I had the drive you do. Eagle scout/ ent/ honest... Please run for president when you can. You have at least my vote :)."
534,"Yes, Hillary is so progressive. If you know, being against gay marriage until very recently, being a war monger, and pushing to keep the privatized healthcare system means being progressive. Hillary is only progressive when you compare her to the far right crazies. I guess at least this image acknowledges Bernie's existence tho."
901,"I like to remind people that we've had gay marriage up here for years, and we haven't seen anyone tearing up their marriage licenses or marrying their tortoises yet."
850,The big difference here is that gay marriage and pot don't upset the vested interests. Cap and trade failed to pass the Senate even when Democrats had a majority because the Dems from coal producing states were against it.
1118,"It's because gay men only target heterosexual married men, which in turn ruins families. Everyone knows that, Michelle Bachman told me once."
521,"As a republican I am hoping he does. The tea party influence is too much, I don't want Jesus in politics or hard right mentalities that have been dominating for the last few years. Most of us (that I know) are not concerned with gay marriage or planned parenthood, or the other bullshit talking points of the current Republican Party."
643,True that. Uruguay is a pretty socially liberal country. LGBT marriage was also legalized there far sooner than in the US.
910,"It's SATIRE. Not a shop, not irony. It's satire used to make a point about churches condemning gay marriage. The guy is wearing a priest's collar!"
104,"A similar thing happened with two Russian Olympian ladies. Kissing is a common platonic greeting there, and the two women were both married with children, but the picture of them kissing ran with an article about them being gay-rights heroes, which of course could get them arrested or killed in Russia. EDIT: http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/4-reasons-not-to-use-stolen-images-to-make-political-point/"
79,My aunt is gay. Her and my uncle got a divorce about 20 years ago (for reasons not having to do with my aunt being gay). They are both remarried and the four of them are quite good friends! My aunt's current wife actually introduced my uncle and his current wife.
962,"Most poor conservatives are single issue voters. Whether it be abortion, gun rights, or same-sex marriage. A lot of them also have fears relating to the economy, naturally. So they vote for the people who are big on business, and are under the false pretense that the economy will be improved for *them* under a conservative agenda. The economy gets better overall, but not for anyone who was previously struggling. There is a reason both the Great Depression and Great Recession occurred after a Republican administration and were fixed by a liberal one. Liberal economics take a long time to get started, but when they do they actually produce fruitful returns for consumers if done correctly. I have never seen a conservative economic policy help anyone but the rich."
765,I don't understand how a gay marriage changes man/woman marriage. I had people say that to me when prop 8 was being voted on in CA. I asked a neighbor how it affected her marriage. She said it lessens her marriage. I wasn't going to remind her she was divorced but I wanted to because I'm sure it wasn't because of gay marriage. This is one of the things that really pisses me off about conservatives. They want smaller gov't until it comes to telling people how to live their lives by the conservatives beliefs. MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS!!!
663,"Thing is, ultimately her and her husband pushed and enacted policies *they could get passed at the present time* that were major improvements for LGBT folks compared to the norm. Before DADT the military would actively set up honeypot situations and other traps to sniff out gay soldiers, including blackmailing them to expose others, and while DOMA set restrictions on the federal level it was the alternative to *a goddamn constitutional amendment that would be a gigantic pain to override.* This is the thing I can't get about people who go on about how Clinton doesn't do enough, she works with the tools and the environment she *has* and even if progress is incremental it's still progress that can be built upon later - like Obama finally overthrowing DADT in favor of enlistment nondiscrimination during his tenure and appointing justices that overturned DOMA and ruled that gay marriage must be considered equally legal as traditional. MLK didn't fucking gun straight for the civil rights act, for example, he built his path to it brick by brick with things like getting bus segregation overturned."
410,"I live in Indianapolis, and this is all any of us can talk about right now. At least for the young adult crowd. I'm 28, and it's all over my facebook (mostly against, but some for), and I hear it in the streets walking to work. It's pretty much the talk of the town at the moment, which it should be. Governor Pence has also said on Twitter that he looks forward to signing it into law, which is pissing a lot of people off. It's the biggest nonsense ever, and to me, it seems like right wing backlash against gay people getting the right to marry in Indiana just a short while back. ""Fine, you can marry, but we ain't gonna let you in our god dang stores!"" It's a bunch of bullshit, and for a state that's trying really hard to attract the younger generation to stay and work, they're doing a really fucking shitty job."
685,"This is why it's so hard to understand how there's ever going to be a compromise. Now that the election is over people are saying that Americans should all try to get along and respect each other. But these hateful views on the LGBT cannot be respected. How can you respect the view that ""gays can't marry because I don't believe it's right""? You can't compromise with that, it's opposition to the rights of another citizen."
972,"I'm kinda with you, but gay marriage and transgender rights are human rights issues. Protecting civil rights should be one of our highest priorities. And as /u/rippledshadow said, the drug war is also a systemic problem that is greatly contributing to the income inequality/working wages issue."
1609,gay people would be married. weed would be legal. laws wouldn't be nearly so specific (fuck license plate stickers) and dancing. There would be so much dancing.
1801,"I can help you with that. Right now, the current law is unconstitutional. You cannot separate gay marriages from straight marriages for the purpose of determining the legitimacy of an IVF child. This new legislation addresses that by making ANY IVF child illegitimate, thereby closing the door on remedying their theo-fascist current law, by replacing it with a blanket theo-fascist determination. The whole motivation for this is that the Tennessee GOP has a black oily substance where their soul should be."
748,"step it up, skirt and cami, breast implants, trick em into falling in love, marry, two kids, retire, move to florida, death bed, whisper ""fooled you, homo"" kiss on head goodbye, slowly waste away. that would be such a sick burn."
1625,"If Kim Davis had only stated that she was against gay marriages, it would be equivalent. She actually went beyond speech and denied marriage licenses to people."
701,"If someone says ""Thank you jesus for this blessed day"" on facebook, I say nothing. When someone says ""I can't believe they're passing that law that lets gay people get married. It's so wrong"", that's when I put on my atheist hat and comment. If what they say is innocuous, it's not big deal. But I will not sit by and let someone say something awful and/or ignorant and give them a free pass because we're supposed to ""respect others beliefs"". Not gonna happen. I'd rather be an asshole."
870,"As a gay man, I can tell her that it's up for her to do the work, not her 'allies' and that is why fat acceptance has gone nowhere in the same 50 years that gay rights have taken us from prisons to marriage."
1479,"That's probably fair. Maybe it looks more 'ugly' nowadays because of the wealth of information that we have, or that we're more liberal about certain things than previous generations before us which have generated dialogue, e.g. gay marriage, abortion, women's rights, more open and complex sexualities, etc."
374,"Knew someone who was complaining that ""Gays shouldn't get married because it ruins the sanctity of marriage"". While that statement itself is pretty dumb, keep in mind this person was on their third marriage."
889,"Something that bothers me is that a lot of religious people think gay people have it easy now that gay marriage is legal. Being a gay kid subjects you to a form of psychological torture, especially if you're growing up in a religious family. Your own family teaches you that something you can't change will send you to hell. Peers ostracize you. There's a reason teen lgbt suicide rates are so high."
567,"His supporters lied. Trump has never been pro-legalization, pro-gay marriage, etc. I still don't get how people don't call them out on this crap. I still have people tell me that Trump is a proponent of gay marriage because he held up a flag despite Trump himself saying that he is against gay marriage using actual clearly spoken words."
916,"I'm in support of gay rights. They should be treated equally (right to marry, spousal benefits, adoption, etc.). But it is a fact that those particular sexual behaviours do have a greater risk of STI transmission. Political correctness does not ever trump fact."
871,I learned this from Karl Rove who engineered anti-gay marriage amendments in 11 states to help George W. Bush win reelection in 2004. Remember.... at one time gay marriage was a 'bad thing'.
1270,"Were your parents supportive of your marriage, or even relationships with women, before the child was born? This might just be homophobia."
570,#No you're totally right. Especially my gay friends: your candidate literally was against gay marriage for a vast majority of her political career.
650,"As a gay person I'm very worried about this. It'd be one thing to undo marriage equality and push it back to the states. I'd have to deal with it, maybe move to a blue state, maybe just wait it out. But it could go so much further. In the next four years we could see it banned on a federal level so it doesn't matter where you live. But it might not even stop there. We could end up with anti-gay laws on the level of Russia, where it's illegal to even be gay. At that point, there's no longer a place in this country for me and my wife."
912,40% of highly religious German Muslims are in favour of same-sex marriage? That's actually amazing. It seems higher than the proportion of highly religious Christian conservatives in the US who support it. And about the same as the average populations of many secular countries.
109,"Dude, my MIL is married to a lady, so now I have 2 MIL's, and they visit at the same time. 2 old lady lesbians, one that isn't the fondest of men..... yeah. I don't mind when they don't visit."
82,It's a little weird that they're willing to break a wholly different religious rule (no divorce) in order to protest the breaking of another religious rule (no same-sex marriage). It's sort of like murdering your neighbor because coveting isn't frowned upon.
988,"What direction are we moving on social issues? We're still arguing health reform, the most popular subjects to debate with no action are gay marriage and gun laws. We still haven't improved the economic structure with small changes starting with providing a living wage to all Americans. We have no comprehensive Immigration reform and we are continuing to militarize the police."
794,"Wow, way too many gay marriage photos. It's really not that big of a deal, one would've sufficed. Where's the picture of the launch of Soyuz spacecraft? Or the chaotic Turkish protests? Aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan? This seems very one sided."
670,"It's not about reversing Obergefell. It's about creating a second class of ""marriage"" and sticking gays in it - this class doesn't get any rights, though, and you can discriminate at will. But they're still ""married!"" This is the new strategy."
441,DAE support gay marriage but hate gay people?? LET'S ASSOCIATE A PERSON WE DON'T LIKE WITH BEING GAY BECAUSE BEING GAY SUCKS!!11 XD XD XD
730,"I don't care what you believe, as long as it doesn't harm people. Unfortunately, Christian beliefs are infringing on my rights and the rights of those I love (gay marriage as the most relevant example right now). In some places women are still treated as lesser beings because of religious beliefs, children are beaten, gay people murdered, and the list goes on. I am only against your beliefs when you use them to mistreat others. I would say the same to an atheist who was using their belief in no higher power to validate hurting other people. But this does not come up nearly as often and when it does they are usually a lone wolf, not backed by a large, unified group"
1271,"Good, almost as many Gay people will now have the right to get married in New York as already have that equal rights in Canada."
1611,"From my almost 30 years as a homosexual (well I suppose closer to 20 actually knowing it...) I can assure you it is nothing but natural. If I had gotten to choose, I wouldn't have chosen to be someone that was hated and misunderstood by so many. Would I change now if I could? No of course not- I love who I am and I'm happily married- but would the 15 year old me have chosen to be straight? Absolutely. It was terrifying at that age but nature does what it does!!"
1849,"If two same-sex people want to join in a union and have all the same legal rights as heterosexual couples, I don't have a problem with that. But the left made it about changing the definition of marriage which I believe is between a man and a woman."
779,"At first I was like ""why is 'loves america but also loves marriage equality and women's rights' stated like they hardly happen together"". Then I read your comment and was like ""alright then -- that's why"". And then I was like ""why do I keep talking to myself."" When the other voices answered I knew it was time to take my meds."
1643,"Gays and Lesbians: How many of you are *against* legalizing same-sex marriage? If so, why? I once worked with a gay guy who didn't agree with it, and I'm still not sure why. Apathy, I suppose."
724,This actually makes perfect sense. Everyone knows natural disasters are just God's punishment for homosexuality. So eliminating gay marriage will eliminate natural disaster.
884,I live in Germany and the subject was constantly on zhe news a few months back.. They were all critizing America for not allowing same sex marriage.. Turns out germany doesn't allow it either. Strange
1490,"Gay marriage wasn't gaining traction because gay people fought harder, it was gaining traction because you had a group of allies 10 times the size of the actual community."
387,I would like to invite Jeff Session to come up to Seattle and smoke a joint with our gay married mayor.
898,"Best argument I have ever read. It would be nice if the opponents of gay marriage could admit that the core of their opposition is homophobia. I find it ironic, as homosexuality generally makes me uncomfortable (I wish it didn't), that the distinction between this and legal rights cannot be drawn. As someone who is uncomfortable with man on man action, I can still recognize the right of all people to pursue what makes them happy. I don't understand why this is hard for religious nutjobs. The bible has very little to say in the matter compared to other things like how women are second class citizens, so how can they cling to that? Why can't we admit that some of us are homophobes and find a way to cope with that?"
595,"The entire country was against gay marriage for most of Hillary's career. Hell, I was against gay marriage back then and I'm gay. Change came quickly and Hillary changed with the rest of the country. Trump is still against marriage. I have no idea why some people want to give Trump a pass for currently being anti-gay, while holding it against Clinton that she was against gay marriage back when everyone else was too."
920,Well the people who are opposed to gay marriage also think Hollywood is destroying America so this doesn't really make the desired point.
908,"The day that Lee Atwater and Karl Rove injected steroids into Nixon's Southern Strategy and filled the ranks of the GOP with angry, easily manipulated white, low educated Christian fundamentalists is the day that any hope of returning the party to Eisenhower-style conservative centrism died. The modern GOP has now been fully infected with white nationalism and they have no more chance (in their current form) to appeal to non whites as their voting base is likely to admit interracial marriage is okay, that LGBTs have the right to be married or that science is more informed than creationism."
1358,"My kids go to school in what has to be one of the most liberal, own fart-smelling towns in northern California and there are a good amount of the kids that have gay parents. And I have to say, those kids are some of the happiest, well adjusted, smartest kids at that school. ""Fucking fags ruining the sanctity of marriage."" HA!"
627,"Quality of life is good here. Politics tends to be a little less partisan and cut-throat. There are fewer extremists of any kind. Things like abortion and gay marriage aren't discussed on a regular basis. Economically, Canadians are actually much more pro-business and fiscally conservative than Fox News might portray, but we also like our social safety net. Generally, Canadians are centre to right-leaning on economics, but liberal and ""laissez faire"" on social issues. Like the US, we have more conservative parts of the country (Alberta) and more liberal (Quebec is almost socialist). Really, in terms of every day life, it isn't very different from the States."
720,"Confederate flag removal, Obamacare subsidies upheld now gay marriage is legal everywhere. Somebody better call and put the entire south on suicide watch."
925,"Churches can refuse to marry ANY couple for any reason. Catholic Church won't marry a hetero couple of either member has been married and divorced before. My cousin's Catholic Church wouldn't conduct his wedding because his bride was Jewish (they got married elsewhere). If churches can legally discriminate against people based on marital status and religion legally, why the fuck do people believe they will be forced to marry same sex couples? This argument against gays is such a redherring. Churches are allowed to discriminate! They always have been and they always will be! No church has been forced to officiate a gay wedding ever."
112,"I'm a gay man, but due to certain health issues stemming from childhood illness I'm functionally asexual. For us it's like best friends living together. Married 23 years now and it's wonderful. My situation is weird and I wouldn't say it's for everyone, but we make a good team and she is still helping me recover from a bad childhood."
83,"The Pope is dope, China landed on the moon, we became more obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence, Putin went more crazy, Utah allowed gay marriage, Psy made songs people loved but couldn't understand, Miley Cyrus made us worry more about our daughters, civil unrest enveloped the world, Nelson Mandela died, Detroit continued to burn, Lance Armstrong cheated, North Korea threatened everyone, Hugo Chavez died, Boston Marathon bombing, chemical weapons kill in Syria, Iran makes a nuclear deal, and US government shuts down. Oh, and this is all on a government server somewhere, and now I know that."
1073,"I'm straight and I've had a beautiful marriage to a gay man where we've adopted and raised two lovely children and been there for each other in our... hardest... times, and also banged passionately every night for the last ten years, each time ending in a face to face cuddle where we stare lovingly into each other's faces until we fall asleep. And that's still not even in the top 10 gayest things I've done."
942,Gay marriage! Or just gays in general; I used to be a huge homophobe until I realized that who another person loves doesn't affect me in the slightest.
691,"If he nominates 2 supreme court justices, and he's guaranteed one, the votes are potentially there to uphold laws that not only end marriage equality, but to actually criminalize gay relationships. Prior to the Lawrence v Texas ruling in 2003, it was a crime to have sex with someone of the same gender in several states. Thomas dissented from that opinion and once Trump gets a nominee through, there will be 3 new conservative members since the case, and Roberts and Alito have voted against marriage equality since joining the court. Losing, for example, Ginsberg could potentially be enough to make every one of us criminals in conservative states for private, consensual, sex."
451,"Oh it's 100% annoying, especially if they say ""I don't believe in gay marriage, but you're cool anyways."" That's when you get cut off and see why she doesn't have many friends."
754,"So he doesn't have any moral or religious objection to gays and gay marriage, just a normal politician. Not that bad for a Republican in the South."
1343,I'm 100% in support of gay marriage and rights...and that is still one of the funniest things I've seen this week.
1687,"You do realize most animals engage in homosexual behavior, but NONE of them participate in either marriage or hating on homosexuals, right?"
1894,SCOTUS affirmed the right of same-sex couples to *marriage* -- they didn't necessarily establish a right of gay people not to be discriminated against (unfortunately).
792,"""Gay marriage should be illegal because if enough gay people start getting married and having sex, normal people will become so disgusted by it that they will stop having sex, leading to the eventual and inevitable destruction of the human race as we know it."""
1669,"Why aren't these true believers trying to outlaw divorce and adultery? They claim to want to protect the sanctity of marriage, but only when equal rights are given to gay and lesbian couples."
726,"Simply put, science is repeatable for everyone - you can find your own evidence. If I tell you gravity exists, you can test it yourself. You can take a pencil and drop it one hundred times and it will always drop. I can show other people my data and repeat my experiments to show them that gravity works. Religion is not repeatable for everyone - if it were, everyone would convert to one 'true' religion. You and I can both pray to different gods - you to Allah and me to Zeus, and we can both feel spiritual and receive 'revelation'. But then if I pray to Allah and you pray to Zeus, odds are you won't feel a thing *because you don't believe in Zeus.* So when I tell you that Zeus told me gay marriage is holy and good, you won't be able to believe me because my word isn't evidence for you. My parents are mormon. They believe that God and Jesus talk to them directly, and that if *anyone* reads the book of mormon and prays about it, god will let them know that the book is true and the mormon church is the *only* true church. My parents will not listen to any other ideas or reasoning about religion because for them their prayers are concrete evidence for their faith. I have read and prayed about their book for years and have never felt anything, even though I sincerely wanted to believe it. Their evidence was not repeatable for me, and therefore is not evidence as it is not repeatable for everyone."
895,"I think this is a weird (though obviously not uncommon) thing to post on here to rip someone about. Ten years ago, more than 50% of Americans opposed gay marriage, and now that number is something like only 30%. I have no doubt whatsoever that Paris' opinion on gays and gay rights has changed 180 degrees since she said that quote. We could put up pictures of Paris Hilton with quotes like this (or along the same lines similar picture / quotes relating to things Paula Deen said 30 years ago), or we could put up pictures of each of the 50 million Americans whose opinions have changed over the past 10 years (250 million U.S. adult citizens x 20% who have changed their minds on gay marriage), but no, we do stuff like this and get in hysterics about it because it makes us feel better about ourselves even though I guarantee a lot of the people doing this would fall into that group of people whose opinions have also changed since she said this quote however long ago."
1491,"Scalia doesn't need to convince them gay marriage is bad, just that the right isn't guaranteed by the Constitution and that it should be up to states to decide. Kennedy has generally been gay friendly though and Roberts might be pragmatic because he knows the direction public opinion so I'm predicting 6-3."
399,"If there's a redesign of the 'Murican flag, certain people will freak the fuck out! A negro is president, gays can get married, marijuana is legal, and a whole new state full of illegal Mexicans."
911,It's a topic that gets brought up with some frequency by opponents of same sex marriage and same sex adoption. They often claim that kids brought up in that environment will be bullied and so it would be better not to allow it.
639,"He's Republican. He's opposed to abortion, same sex marriage (though he wants the law to change so that there isn't a difference legally), and a few other things that don't sit well with non Republicans. He's leaning Libertarian on some issues such as this and things like police demilitarization, which is understandable as his father is Ron Paul (a leading Libertarian politician). His Libertarian leanings can also put people off."
931,"Garbage argument. A lot of shit used to be illegal, and now is legal. We can acknowledge the mistakes of our past and move on. That doesnt mean that everything should be legal. Not that i would argue against gay marriage."
929,"""You know, I have to tell you, I really loved our democratic, half-black president Obama and was going to vote for him again, but I just can't do it now that he's supporting gay marriage."""
1418,"Get her pregnant, marry that bitch, raise a fuckin family, and then ask that cunt on her deathbed ""who's the faggot now?"""
648,"Bold move posting this. Seems too 'political'. Maybe you should have linked another article on the confederate flag or gay marriage, because those issues aren't political at all."
739,Some day its gonna be pretty awkward for a nation when its one of the last countries in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.
928,"As a Christian, I'm glad she's getting arrested. If she feels strongly against giving gay people marriage certificates, she should quit. Its not like she's being forced to do anything. She is choosing to stay in the position."
136,"My dad has gone within 5-7 years from opposing gay marriage to making fun of people who oppose it. When Kim Davis was on TV, he literally texted us pictures of her with captions like ""look at that toothless inbred redneck!"" I'd love to see what would happen if 2016!Dad met 2010!Dad and debated gay marriage."
84,"Best I've heard was a guy inviting his old highschool friend over, they hadn't talked in years. He proposed to her and she thought he was kidding. He broke down crying and then admitted that he was gay and just really wanted to be married because he was going to a christian college and everyone was starting to suspect."
1136,"The official language is Mandarin. Funding from environmental protection and the military is diverted to education and sciences. Whaling is legal. College education is mandatory and free. The office of President is hereditary. Statues to Jackie Chan everywhere. Every Sunday is dumpling day. Hong Kong isn't getting independence anytime soon. The Philippines is going to hand over the South China Sea. Taipei will surrender to Beijing. There'll be a huge wave of immigration from China. Top American universities will be filled with even more Chinese students. The Four Classics will be required reading in all schools. Buddhism and Chinese Folk Religion will be encouraged. America will pull support from the Isreal-Palenstine conflict, and let them fight it out. Lawyers get extra taxes, teachers get less. The corn fields will be replaced with rice. The White House will be made more colorful. Gay marriage is outlawed. Marijuana is outlawed. Drinking age is lowered. Beer production will be discouraged, and replaced with wine. Prostitution will be outlawed. Stripping will be outlawed. Premarital sex will be heavily discouraged. Abortions are legal, but state controlled and very secret. Dog meat is legal. Mexican food will be discouraged."
949,"I think many Catholics see a big difference between gay marriage and gay people: he specifically said he did not care if *priests* were gay (who cares? They're supposed to be chaste!) and that they need to be accepted and loved *as people*. He may reverse his stance, but as of now I do not think he would consider his statement yesterday a contradiction of your quote."
712,"This is greatly embarrassing for America... but lets not forget that just a few months ago Gay Marriage was made the law of the land in the supreme court. These people may have won some kind of battle in their minds here, but they are losing the war."
483,"""I wish these faggots would quit talking about getting married."" or ""Good God what is up with the faggots, isn't fucking a guy in the ass punishment enough? Now you want to do it to the poor guy for the rest of his life?!?!?!"""
775,"Really, the choice thing is a red herring. If someone *did* choose to be gay I still wouldn't give a shit. If it was absolutely proved to me tomorrow that homosexuality was a choice, my positions on gay marriage, adoption, etc. would be just as liberal as they are now. Just don't hurt anybody and I'm fine with whatever."
1404,We just need one more to turn and we'll have equal marriage rights for all in NY. If you haven't written or called your state representatives there is no better time than right now!! The bill could be up for a vote today!
1798,"Ooh ooh the intersection of feminism and sex workers is actually really interesting! Because in the past, in order to join mainstream American society, groups (meaning anyone like nonwhite or nonmale) basically had to prove that they were moral and nonthreatening and stuff. Think about how Jews are basically portrayed as nebbishes (in Woody Allen films, even Jon Stewart), or how gay couples are starting to portray themselves as just wanting to get married and raise children rather than crazy drug-using swingers as they were in earlier eras. So although prostitutes had been some of the earliest financially self-sufficient women, in order for women to really join mainstream society and get the vote, feminists (suffragettes in those days) had to reject them! In feminist thought today (don't make the mistake of thinking there's only ONE way of looking at the world from a feminist viewpoint, it's an ongoing dialog), there's actually a lot of divisiveness about this issue, with some arguing that sex workers are exploited and some arguing, as you do, that women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and so on. I think it's actually really interesting."
1896,"So you're telling me that Florida allows Pastafarians to construct ""shrines"" for the Flying Spaghetti Monster yet they're still trying to extend their ban on same-sex marriage? I quit."
800,The only crime here isn't the fashion. It's the fact you two were married then unmarried because some people can't handle that being gay was never a bad thing. Politics.
1707,"Because the sanctity of marriage is the only argument against gay marriage that sounds somewhat plausible. Their actual reason of ""It's yucky and I think it's gross"" doesn't sound good on TV."
390,"From my understanding, she's hated by the majority of the LGBT community. Partially because she committed manslaughter and partially because of the damaging things she's said about same-sex marriage, the LGBT community itself, ect."
1563,I have a feeling they will get this cleared up real quick. I own a local news outlet and have written multiple articles on the Texas county I cover not yet issuing marriage licenses. They say they are waiting for a computer update. Can't find anyone that has attempted to get a license yet. But I have had multiple lawyers from some of the largest firms in the country contact me after reading my articles and tell me to give any same-sex couples that I run across that have been denied their info and they will gladly represent them pro bono.
1725,"Exactly. It's just a form of cultural conditioning, just like how some conservative Christians view gays as ""literally the devil"" or think that people should not have sex until marriage."
347,"""If Mary Tyler Moore married and divorced Steven Tyler, then married and divorced Michael Moore, then got into a three-way lesbian marriage with Demi Moore and Mandy Moore, would she go by the name Mary Tyler Moore Tyler Moore Moore Moore?"""
666,"That's something that has always surprised me. These salt of the earth, manly men look down on people being homophobic. They see it as petty and a waste of time. I'd consider my father to kind of fit into that category. While he may have made some bigoted remarks (jokingly of course), when it came down to it his view on gay marriage and everything concerning homosexuality in general, was to mind your own business."
1698,I remember that when there was a chemical spill in West Virginia that poisoned the drinking water. Fox News made a big deal about gay marriage passing in another state. I don't even think Fox reported the chemical spill at all.
1686,"I never thought he was fit to be president, but I used to like Mike Huckabee. Then he offered to serve jail time for that woman who wouldn't give the gay couple a marriage license."
207,Heard the same thing about gay people. The way I see it is even if it was a mental disorder they still function regularly in society and do not hurt anybody so they deserve the same rights as everyone else. Whether it be making changes to ones own body or marrying someone of the same gender we can't look down and oppress people who are not of the norm.
1602,"""Welcome to a western country, were nudity is allowed an ubiquitous, homosexuals can marry, bacon is on the menu, separation of church and state is the law, freedom of speech is cherished, and where you will be arrested for laying a hand on your wife, who, by the way, will be required to unveil herself in the front of a cop during ID checks. Still want to stick around?"""
635,I work for [New Hampshire Freedom to Marry.](http://nhftm.org/) We could always use the money. I'd be happy to write them thank you cards and forward letters in support of marriage equality from our clergy coalition.
809,"Same reasons. If I don't harm you while enjoying my own activity, then you shouldn't prevent me from doing that activity. It's also the same argument for gay marriage or legalizing prostitution. A crime needs to have a victim in order to be a crime."
243,"The thing is that's not even in the Bible. It says that God only hates sin, but loves all people. I am Christian, but I'm also fine with gay marriage. It's a matter of me not caring what other people do. Plus, marriage lost all right to being ""holy"" once divorce became legal."
291,I remember this fucker...Wasn't he pushed out of the AL Supreme Court for telling county clerks that they didn't have to issue gay marriage licences?
175,"This is not necessarily R-rated, but pretty controversial for middle and high schools. Homosexual behavior was actually decently widespread in the 1920s, and becoming more visible. Married men and women would sometimes have lovers of the same sex on the side, and gender roles began to become blurred in popular media. It's actually a very interesting topic. I'd suggest [this book](http://books.google.com/books?id=PW1GjP0_6Y4C) for a more complete history."
267,People like this dude and the couple that vowed divorce if gay marriage was legalized need to understand gay marriage is going to happen anyway and that its not going to destroy the world.
295,"They did a few years ago to make gay marriage illegal. Currently they are stripping powers from the governor to obstruct the incoming democrat. Reducing his staff hiring capability from 1500 to 300, forcing him to keep his rival's staff, among other power grabs. Once they stack the deck to be able to amend the constitution without opposition, you better believe they will, these guys are relentless."
445,"I always found it ironic whenever I hear republicans saying they want a small government that doesn't interfere with the lives of citizens...yet republicans interfere with the lives of citizens the most. No gay marriage, no abortion, no marijuana, no separation of church and state, etc etc etc. only thing democrats interfere with is what...guns? Which is the only thing that actually can affect other people's safety. Everything else doesn't affect anyone in the slightest besides those partaking"
250,"Insanity. Also does he not realize that every single one of those 10,000 refugees they pledged to hire are anti gay marriage? The delusion is strong with this one."
1466,"At this point it's entirely expected. The health minister Jeremy Hunt believes in homoeopathy, the previous environmental minister didn't believe in global warming, and the Minister for Equalities opposed same sex marriage."
272,"As a black man I can confirm this, the statues have never been brought up in conversation with anyone I know. Only on social media and the news am I seeing this virtue signaling about it. Also it is mostly millenial blacks that have been indoctrinated by marxists and ghetto blacks who pretty much just read headlines and believe it. Believe it or not most blacks are socially conservative on things like gay marriage and all this gender bullshit. The media and Democrats just influence them because most are not really deep into politics. They just watch the news and catch headlines on social media. I was not even involved until Ron Paul in 2012. Now I am addicted to red pills."
