1485,"Actually it's because roaches started allowing gay marriage, simultaneously destroying the integrity of every roach family and also halting new births."
572,"What the heck is a liberal and conservative viewpoint anymore? Like I consider myself pro choice and pro gay marriage but more for the ""government should leave us the fuck alone in most cases"" line of reasoning. Those are technically viewed as liberal views now but the reasoning behind why I believe them is more conservative if that makes any sense."
865,"I love Macklewis, just the first thing I thought of that probably set the overzealous moms off. Well that and the whole supporting gay marriage thing."
378,"While normally I would say that a comic such as this is irrelevant considering many engage in all of the things shown. However, in one specific case, I work with a man who is about 65 although he looks 85 and can barely speak/get around. The man smokes 2 packs a day, takes at least 50 mg of hydrocodone a day, drinks a 6 pack after work and literally drinks a pot and a half of coffee per day. In his mind none of these things are drugs and are acceptable, but as soon as marijuana is mentioned he goes on rants (which sound like gears grinding due to his smoking habit) about how pot is a terrible drug and will, along with the same sex marriage ruling, lead to the downfall of the United States. The hypocrisy and ignorance is real."
801,"Facebook, Barack Obama, the recession, BP oil spill, the Batman trilogy, marriage equality becoming a reality, and Justin Bieber off the top of my head."
432,"Fellow CA resident here and I agree with you. Smoke dope, shoot guns, have a polygamist gay marriage, terminate your pregnancy, do your own thing."
95,"Very true. That's one of the arguments I have with Republicans. They feel they want ""more freedom,"" yet are against gay marriage, weed, abortion, etc. How can you use freedom as a selling point for your party when all you want to do is take it away from people?"
642,In not a liberal. I am registered republican. I only seem liberal because I believe that hurricanes are caused by high barometric pressure and not gay marriage. -McAvoy
580,You would hate my situation. I'm gay and married a guy with the same name and he took my last name so those are the same now too.
214,"Please, someone explain this to me: how can a physician, trained in medical science, be against Planned Parenthood, against the ACA, believe that tobacco is not a drug, oppose gun control, be in favor of job discrimination based on sexual orientation, be against same-sex marriage, against environmental regulations, and against funding public radio?"
132,"We had the ban on gay marriage lifted recently here in Wisconsin. When it happened a lot of comments on social media were something like ""How can they do that, doesn't the Bible say gay marriage is a sin?"" Comments like that made me want to pull my hair out."
55,That the choir director was fooling around with a female student. When she turned 18 they got married. Bonus - it was strongly assumed he was gay due to his impressive level of fabulous.
176,"I honestly don't think there's going to be that much of an increase in gay sex tonight... Probably not too many ""save-it-for-marriage"" gay people out there."
14,I feel bad for all the gay people in long-term relationships that DON'T want to get married. Things just got super awkward
120,Does that mean that states that haven't explicitly *allowed* gay marriage but also haven't banned it now must issue marriage licenses to gay couples? Or does it just mean that if a vote goes out to add language to allow gay marriages and it passes the state can't ban it anyway?
445,"I always found it ironic whenever I hear republicans saying they want a small government that doesn't interfere with the lives of citizens...yet republicans interfere with the lives of citizens the most. No gay marriage, no abortion, no marijuana, no separation of church and state, etc etc etc. only thing democrats interfere with is what...guns? Which is the only thing that actually can affect other people's safety. Everything else doesn't affect anyone in the slightest besides those partaking"

150,"Being gay, I fear a Pence presidency. Trump might be pompus and rude, but at least his stance on stuff like marriage equality seems to be ""meh. whatever. Leave it be.""."
80,"When people say ""If we let the gays marry, next we'll let people marry dogs."" Or when someone says anything disparagingly about Tarantino films. Both are pretty equal."
248,"People underestimate how big of a shift has happened. In 2007 the guy running on the left during the Democratic primary was against gay marriage (although with a wink and a nod that he'd shift on the issue), but by the time the 2016 election came around even the Republican nominee was for it."
558,"I also won't be leaving a $15 to $18 million dollar estate to University of Alabama because of state's war on same-sex marriage. In the event they change their stance on same-sex marriage, then I won't be leaving it to them for my second reason: I'm poor."
548,As a citizen of the EU I'd be more than happy to take the credit for marriage equality. However it's not just our accomplishment but the accomplishment of many. I am however glad my country (the Netherlands) has been on the forefront of this movement.
258,"Marriage is an important part of getting ahead: lets people know you're not a homo; married guy seems more stable; people see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch; ladies see the ring, they know immediately you must have some cash or your cock must work."
114,"I think most do these days, most conservatives I know care much more about economic issues than things like gay marriage that quite don't affect them in the slightest."
424,"And the morning talk shows are full of stories about Sheila and Shannon who lost their jobs because they voted against gay marriage wahhhhhh! No, ya mongs, it's because you post virulent homophobic rants about hypothetical gay customers on Facebook and your employers find it bad for business, so the free market does what it does best and gives you the boot."
135,This actually happens quite a bit - remember among the first judges to rule against gay marriage bans was a Bush appointment (and gay).
370,So THIS is what they meant when they said gay marriage being legalized would destroy traditional marriage! It all makes sense now!
156,"Getting a divorce from an interracial gay marriage, the getting remarried to someone of a different religion after you both had a sex change, in a non religious ceremony, then adopting a child who identfies as the opposite sex."
10,"I had a student start spreading rumors that I was cheating on my wife with her. I'm gay, I'm married to a man. My boss and I had a good laugh about that silly rumor."
619,I support gay marriage but even I recognize the idiocy of comparing someone against it to a Nazi. That's more trashy to me.
529,"Fucking seriously. It's not like transgender people just started existing in the last 5 years, it was never a problem really anyone cared about other than LGBT people until conservatives lost the gay marriage battle and decided it was a way to curry favor with their base."
306,"Like all things, I hope they consider the implications before charging steadfast into married life. Straight or gay, divorces are costly."
23,"When I was 19 I briefly dated a guy who wanted to get married and talked about it early on, so it felt very serious. One day we met up to study together and he made a comment about how disgusting he found gay people to be and it really bothered me. I didn't know what I say so I sat quietly for a long time as he talked and a million things went through my mind. He started to sense that I was upset so he leaned in and quietly asked me if I was ""one of those black girls who pretends to be nice and sweet at first but is actually just angry and mad a lot?"" Being the type of person I am/was, I said no and he said ""good"" and went to class. I stopped answering his phone calls/texts and spoke to him only one time after that. He was a special kind of idiot."
673,"I tried to understand the connection between large women, pickup trucks and homosexuality and now I'm filling out a marriage license with my new husband in the cab of our new Ford F-150. Be careful, it could happen to you."
824,"She also was married to a man who turned out to be gay, and then went on to study homosexuality and write a book where she concluded that it should be immediately legalized and tolerated. In India. In the 1970s."
283,"It was a poorly phrased meme, but SCOTUS justices do vote on which laws to strike down as unconstitutional. The legal reasoning that he used to support the states rights to make gay marriage illegal is the exact same legal reasoning that was used to support states' rights to make interracial marriage illegal. His legal argument would have made his own marriage illegal."
301,"The Republican leadership isn't Christian at all, doesn't care about abortion or gay marriage or any of that stuff, but just pretends they are religious to get enough votes to stay in power so that they can keep taxes low on the rich."

166,"The fact that this post title doesn't say ""lesbian marriage proposal"" and just says ""marriage proposal"" says a lot about how we've progressed as a whole"
54,"It's required by the 1937 Constitution. The 2009 law was written in a manner that would render the offence virtually impossible to commit. Nobody has ever been convicted of blasphemy in Ireland, and nobody ever will be. We'll be getting around to removing the requirement from the Constitution within the next few years (it requires a referendum), but since it has no real world effects, other issues have been given priority (e.g. same-sex marriage) since the decision to remove it was made in 2014."
70,"You're telling me the guy who said, ""If we accept same-sex marriage, why not let fathers marry sons for tax breaks?"" is sort of a jerk? No way"
116,"I think people will be shocked at how common and blatant homophobia was. There are senators who openly voice their aversions to homosexuality, whether defending their beliefs with religion or personal morals. And no one thinks twice about it. ""Oh there's that crazy, conservative Christian on tv again talking about how the bible says a man shouldn't lay with another man."" I think in 2060 gay marriage will be so normal that people will marvel at how it was ever a taboo subject."
245,"Thanks for the question. I have always been pro-choice. I am fully supportive of gay rights including the legalization of gay marriage, and full extension of rights to gay couples and individuals. I am for the decriminalization of marijuana."
1509,"People are downvoting me, but this is exactly it. She was a strong female character in the book who reversed a common power dynamic but favoring a male character who she could not marry due to status. I would absolutly favor a strong feminist character over a poorely portrayed token lesbian character."
776,"As a Muslim, I have to step in. First off, I think you're confusing culture with religion, which although tie together in many ways, diverge as well. Secondly, there are many Jewish and Christian countries that have anti-liberal laws and cultures, Israel abuse and and mistreatment of Palestines and Nigerian Christian conservatism that puts gays to death for being gay are two examples that come to mind. Lastly, I myself am a Muslim and consider myself incredibly liberal as I support abortion, gay marriage and the entire LGBTQ community, gender equality, and many other liberal beliefs. Like any ideology, there are different factions and parties and belief system within, it's not so black and white."
1385,"If BP doesn't fix this oil spill before the firecane comes, I hope every single Guantanamo Bay prisoner is rescued by Ron Paul so that they can fill Iraqi shoes with overfished sea-oil and hurl them at Bush's corpse once it's been flotilla'd into the Gaza strip and suspended in a mosque that looks exactly like the world trade center towers except there's an airplane-shaped bomb suspended near the 96th floor that's shaped like the [Halliburton logo](http://tiny.cc/1vrv0)! Furthermore, gays should be allowed to marry cute kittens and/or Helen Thomas because the asshole, liar pope touched my ex's kid (btw can I get some advice for this situation?).

1084,"I’m hoping your Same Sex Marriage plebiscite is successful in the Yes votes. My boyfriend is from Sydney and if the result is that SSM becomes legal, then I will fly over there immediately to get married to him."
511,"I am not gay, I am not American, and I am not involved in any marriage, but I am quite frankly delighted by this news."
207,Heard the same thing about gay people. The way I see it is even if it was a mental disorder they still function regularly in society and do not hurt anybody so they deserve the same rights as everyone else. Whether it be making changes to ones own body or marrying someone of the same gender we can't look down and oppress people who are not of the norm.
938,"She couldn't have actually married the Eiffel Tower, because she keeps referring to it as a ""she"" and same-sex marriage is not legal in France."
635,I work for [New Hampshire Freedom to Marry.](http://nhftm.org/) We could always use the money. I'd be happy to write them thank you cards and forward letters in support of marriage equality from our clergy coalition.

56,The first gay couple was just married in Dallas today. An 82 yr old and an 85 yr old man finally got to be recognized as legally married in the city they call home. The world just became a little bit brighter in our corner of North Texas.
232,"Regardless to the convention of Vatican III, I can see a relaxation of the anti-homosexuality sentiments of the church by a pope (quite possibly Francis) asking people to treat it like any other sin, in addition to supporting CIVIL gay marriage. Otherwise, I really don't think these things are changing. The biggest reason is that the Catholic Church can't ""change"" it's tenets at will. It can only reinterpret what it knows in a more accurate way."
21,"I told my gf that I couldn't get married until gays could out of principle, and now I have to fake my own death. THANKS SUPREME COURT"
198,"Scalia was as close to a libertarian as you could get. He really hated the federal government. A lot of Reddit hates him because he ""voted against gay marriage"", but his ~~descent~~ dissent was built around ""the federal government has no right to govern marriage laws because it's not in the constitution. The states banning gay marriage are dumb but I can't do anything about it."""
564,"I think you're trying to reclaim the word ""conservative"" with its older meaning, and rightfully so. But in 2012, ""conservative republicans"" are pro big government war spending, pro big government Israel spending, pro big government regulations when it applies to women's health care regulations, gay marriage, and Christian religious laws, etc. And most of the rhetoric from conservatives supports this. I welcome a sensible return to a Conservative party that doesn't consist solely of Christian Right warriors, but it's wishful thinking to say that ""REAL conservatives"" are different, because I just don't see them anywhere."
560,"The linked original thread is titled *""Posted by a friend on fb. He openly opposes gay marriage. The irony was unbearable.""*"
1002,"I think in any marriage, you can't be having the same sex all the time. Couples should experiment with new positions to keep their sex lives exciting"
164,"He has a bit of a point, though. The debate on same-sex marriage has been a hot topic, thus it is all over the news, daily. It's time we focus on something else, no?"
180,"LGBT tolerance has risen dramatically. I remember Obama being elected, when gay marriage was legal in what, six states? People were saying it would never happen, but here we are."
98,"""if we allow gay marriage people will start marrying dogs"" yeah no one who's going to marry or have sex with a dog is letting the law get in the way"
271,"The divorce laws **are** gender neutral. There is nothing in the law that says that women should get the kids most of the time. It's the **system** that isn't gender neutral, and I don't think gay marriage is going to change that."
1018,"Between the confederate flag backlash, obamacare, and gay marriage, this has been the best week ever for cleansing friend lists of bigots and idiots."
1027,He also said he would take away the helmet catch and the Giants Super Bowl victory if it meant having same-sex marriage abolished.
324,"I don't see anything wrong with polygamy, it's their own family and I classify it pretty much the same as gay marriage, it is obviously different but how a family works and loves is their own business. I don't think it screws up kids any more than normal things kids go trough in a nuclear family."
125,"2005 wasn't 1965, gay marriage was a hot social issue back then, and most people knew it would eventually be legal."
530,"i am and always have been a very vocal supporter of gay marriage. check out ""my big gay chip"" post on huffington post."
188,Just an FYI: Ireland did not become the first country to legalize gay marriage. It became the first to do it by popular vote.
481,"In 2004, 94% of the county and 75% of the state voted to ban gay marriages. Kim Davis's view isn't exactly controversial and it's unlikely getting out and voting would've made a difference in her county."
253,"Getting a divorce from an interracial gay marriage, the getting remarried to someone of a different religion after you both had a sex change, in a non religious ceremony, then adopting a child who identfies as the opposite sex, then gets a interracial gay marriage at 16."
11,"I didn't stop being bisexual because I married a man. I am not magically straight now. I didn't ""pick a side"" I picked a person. I am still attracted to both men and women. No, I don't need to sleep with women as well to be satisfied, do you have to sleep with other people besides your chosen partner just because your sexuality is the same as it bloody was? No, he doesn't mind. No, he's not trying to set up lesbian mud-wrestling matches between me and other women. He's actually bi too-... What? No he's not secretly gay! No, he's not a creep! He's just-...! Arrrrgh!!!"
1128,Actually the corporation was the entity giving money to anti-marriage equality groups. CEO made the statements but the organization was backing it up financially. They no longer support hate groups as of 2012 and publicly stated that they will leave marriage debates to politicians and continue to make sammiches.
966,"Its fun though, isn't it? The other day I argued with ""myself"" over gay marriage. I was both the President and a Senator from Georgia. I was ranting on and on, pacing sound my room. From the outside, it looks crazy, but from the inside it's really really fun."
316,"I've pledged to pay over $1000.00 over the course of this country that we have to make sure that the campaign doesn't go negative. If you'd like to talk, I'll tell you right now Sanders is in favor of legal and public recognition of gay marriages. Just as the employers always try to make their mimosas go down easier."
31,"I know a nice religious, Super conservative Christian Salvationist. She is homophobic because she knows that it is a sin. She married a man fifteen years her elder, who her church set her up with, and was a virgin on her wedding night.

1606,"I would add Romania, given the irrationally aggressive harassment I received for merely writing in a relevant thread on this sub that Romania should just legalise same-sex marriage (literally 5 Romanian users harrassing me in Private Message, and going through my post history and following me to other subs and threads to inform other people that I'm a gay[otherwise I wouldn't support gay rights, by their logic])."
319,May be wrong but I think it's funny that states that passed defense of marriage laws sped up the passing of same-sex marriage after it's declared unconstitutional. Had they let things alone...
304,"This is the first American president to embrace marriage equality! I'm so happy, but still wondering... what took so damn long?"
336,"Weirdly enough the state of Israel will recognize your same sex marriage, but only if you wed outside of Israel. So if you get married in the USA, and go to Israel, you'll still be considered married."
247,But it won't become legal overnight like gay marriage because too many rich people would lose money if pot became legal
103,"All states must now grant and recognize same sex marriages, or no(edit: not grant) marriages at all. If somebody wanted to challenge this they would first start in their local federal district court. Decisions by the SCOTUS are considered the supreme law of the land, as it's through the interpretation of the Constitution that they determine the legitimacy of the cases. No states need to draft any legislation, and any current standing legislation that bans same sex marriage is now null and void."
86,This needs to get upvoted to the top....if Obama is going to bat for the LGBT community then everyone in favor of gay marriage needs to go to bat for Obama.
118,"The thing I can never get past is just how obviously disingenuous her refusal to marry homosexuals was. She had no problem marrying atheists, agnostics, people of different faiths, unmarried parents, or any other couple who wouldn't fit her religious criteria for 'marriage', yet it was only homosexuals she lost her shit over. I actually do give people a lot of leeway for religious beliefs that they hold genuinely, but I have absolutely no sympathy for those who hide behind their supposed faith to justify their bigotry. If she actually had a problem with signing wedding licenses that went against her religious beliefs, she would have had issues long before this."
344,"When I was young, stupid and didn't know anyone in the LGBT community, I was anti gay marriage. Went to college, made friends in the LGBT community and discovered how ignorant I was. I've always considered myself a democrat. It's OK to evolve, even if the other side does it."
1563,I have a feeling they will get this cleared up real quick. I own a local news outlet and have written multiple articles on the Texas county I cover not yet issuing marriage licenses. They say they are waiting for a computer update. Can't find anyone that has attempted to get a license yet. But I have had multiple lawyers from some of the largest firms in the country contact me after reading my articles and tell me to give any same-sex couples that I run across that have been denied their info and they will gladly represent them pro bono.
1177,"It's like reddit. Supporting gay marriage lets them be smug about how progressive they are while balancing out all the racism, misogyny, eugenics, etc."
1501,I believe the above comment was in reference to Orson Scott Card being openly against the institution of same sex marriage.
437,President James Buchanan was most likely gay. He never married and had a close relationship with Vice President William Rufus King. The two would go to functions together.
1698,I remember that when there was a chemical spill in West Virginia that poisoned the drinking water. Fox News made a big deal about gay marriage passing in another state. I don't even think Fox reported the chemical spill at all.
512,"Conservative Republicans want religion and politics kept strictly separate when it comes to climate-change and income inequality, but they want religious beliefs blended with government to legally impose social conservative stances on abortion and same-sex marriage. Neither the right-wing nor the left-wing should use exegetics as an underlying basis to justify public policies."
227,I find it hilarious how much time the GOP spends fighting issues they have just recently lost. Don't like health care? Let's vote on it 50 more times. Supreme Court rules it unconstitutional to ban gay marriage? Let's try and ban gay marriage. If my mom doesn't get me a pony for Christmas asking for one on December 28th probably isn't going to go much better.
1602,"""Welcome to a western country, were nudity is allowed an ubiquitous, homosexuals can marry, bacon is on the menu, separation of church and state is the law, freedom of speech is cherished, and where you will be arrested for laying a hand on your wife, who, by the way, will be required to unveil herself in the front of a cop during ID checks. Still want to stick around?"""
780,"The problem is they are using what is construed as a biblical term, marriage, to define something that is demonstrably not biblical. Union or partnership would be a better term for laws while marriage is defined specifically for religious ceremonies with no legal binding. If a religion supports same sex marriage it cannot be associated with legality any more than a conventional marriage. To get around this a legal union needs to be defined in the laws and the word marriage should be stricken from all legally binding laws. I think they are fighting this the wrong way. It should be a separation of church and state battle more than a battle of who can marry who."
240,"I'm fine if you're against gay marriage, just don't use a book, in which you've ignored 90% of the other ""rules"" contained in it, as your argument."
426,"Never understood that particular argument in any case. Allowing gay marriage have absolutely zero impact on straight couples ability to have kids (it's not contagious and it won't magically turn ""normal"" people gay)."
647,"and Ruth Davidson giving interviews today about the possible DUP coalition called the conservatives ""the party of gay marriage"". They voted against their own bill, but was passed by Labour and Lib Dem votes and now they want to take credit for it."

1270,"Were your parents supportive of your marriage, or even relationships with women, before the child was born? This might just be homophobia."
521,"As a republican I am hoping he does. The tea party influence is too much, I don't want Jesus in politics or hard right mentalities that have been dominating for the last few years. Most of us (that I know) are not concerned with gay marriage or planned parenthood, or the other bullshit talking points of the current Republican Party."
337,"I almost wonder if it would have happened as quickly if the movement to oppress it hadn't been as forceful. I'm not sure the gay marriage movement would have been quite as quick or reactive. So, I'd like to say thank you in part to all of the bigots for making this day possible."
50,"Back before marriage equality became law, it was also super fucking short-sighted to go celebrate your marriage in a place populated by those who were denied that right."
491,I was listening to an NPR show last week about a youth Trump supporter whose primary motivation was his stance on gay marriage. They came back to talk to him again after Trump said he'd appoint a new justice to change the Supreme Court decision and the guy said that he was just playing the game to get votes.
912,40% of highly religious German Muslims are in favour of same-sex marriage? That's actually amazing. It seems higher than the proportion of highly religious Christian conservatives in the US who support it. And about the same as the average populations of many secular countries.
112,"I'm a gay man, but due to certain health issues stemming from childhood illness I'm functionally asexual. For us it's like best friends living together. Married 23 years now and it's wonderful. My situation is weird and I wouldn't say it's for everyone, but we make a good team and she is still helping me recover from a bad childhood."
1832,"Oh man... I am going to get pounded for this but I swear I don't hold this position myself. The best secular argument I've heard against gay marriage is that the legal institution of marriage provides a mechanism for the government to exert leverage upon the population at the macro level by shaping benefits and obligations of marriage to encourage certain outcomes. The most obvious use is to encourage or discourage population growth and home ownership via tax credits and such. In this view, gay marriage is not immoral so much as it is an externality, and appendiceal inefficiency that does not serve the government's purpose of population control and societal shaping."
149,This. FedEx (or any other Corp) don't give a fuck about gay marriage. They're just being typical scumbags by trying to save money on benefits.
372,"Because it reveals how devoid of humanity they are. Gay people don't need this heterophobic bigotry; it's the very propaganda homophobes push, that straight marriage would be destroyed if gay marriage was allowed."
195,"I was watching the news, and there was a report on the demonstrations against gay marriage and gay rights. The reporter interviewed a black woman. And she managed to say: ""50 years ago, we, the African Americans, fought for free speech and equal rights, and today I use that privilege to stop this monstrosity from happening."" I almost shattered my head due to my fierce facepalm..."
53,"When I was 16, my parents and I were in the process of moving to another state. My parents would go to the state we were moving to every month to look for houses. During one of their trips, it was supposed to be just me and my step brother at home for 4 days. Shortly after they left, my step brother tells me he's going on a trip for 2 of those days to go visit a ""friend"". The thing about him was, he had no friends. He was home schooled and kinda of a asshole, with no social skills. It didn't really bug me though, 2 days home alone when you're a 16 year old punk seemed awesome. When he comes home, I decided to figure out what he did. He said it was a romantic trip. After a while, I finally got it out of him. He met another man on adult friend finder, and had a ""wild weekend"". I had no idea he was gay, I have no problem at all with it, but it was extremely surprising. After a while, he would go on trips every weekend, and wouldn't tell my parents anything. Finally, my mom is begging me to tell her if I knew anything, and I caved. I had to tell my parents that my step brother was gay. They are very liberal and accepting people, but this is when it gets wacky. My step brother's lover was a 50 year old police detective, who was married to another man. He had no hesitation on telling them that he was in love, and they didn't use protection. It made for an interesting summer."
