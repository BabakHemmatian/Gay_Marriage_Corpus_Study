1635,"I would say yes and no to this, at least from my experiences, most youngins are socially liberal (pro-gay, black, etc.) but economically conservative (small gov, lower taxes, less regulation especially on persons). They only VOTE democratic because the republican party is not conservative, they are more religious and shit. Also I would say pro-gay is conservative in a way from at least my conservative view, idgaf what you do on your own time, marry, fuck, I couldn't give less of a shit."
1826,"""If Mary Tyler Moore married and divorced Steven Tyler, then married and divorced Michael Moore, and got into a three-way lesbian marriage with Demi Moore and Mandy Moore, would she go by the name Mary Tyler Moore Tyler Moore Moore Moore?"""
634,"Well, the vivid lands don't fit what we detective-ised as the remaining lands from Origins. So the only thing I could think of would be that it had a rainbow and has to deal with gay marriage. Which is possible given Wizards acceptance of all this stuff, and some of the characters they've made."
844,"Here you go. Gay marriage should remain illegal. The reason is that if gay marriage were recognized by our government, then we have no legal excuse to keep polygamy, first cousin marriages, or group marriages banned. The next group of people claiming to have their civil right of marriage oppressed may belong to this group, and they also are consenting adults. However, a great majority of Americans are uncomfortable with the idea of polygamy, first cousin marriages, or group marriages. Why are we giving preference to the notion that marriage ought to be between only two non-related adults? The number two is as arbitrary as the genders of those involved. Either you legalize it all, or you legalize none of it."
428,I think this is the most normal story in this thread. Nothing special but most likely to happen. Some sort of everyday life in gay marriage straight couple divorces
1888,"We'll have gay marriage and legal pot before you can buy a six pack in a convenience store, mark my words."
549,"It's because ""piss poor"" is the only kind of argument against gay marriage. Those kids are petty clearly NOT the cream of the intellectual crop."
285,"In addition, the African American community is exceptionally religious. For a very long time, God was all they had. Ergo, many of them---strangely enough---see gay marriage as a moral issue, not a civil rights issue. Of course, people point out the now repealed anti-misogynation (I'm sure I spelled it wrong) laws, but... Hypocrisy knows no bounds."
291,I remember this fucker...Wasn't he pushed out of the AL Supreme Court for telling county clerks that they didn't have to issue gay marriage licences?
457,"I like to think that the term ""gay marriage"" will eventually fade from lack of use, so much so that the future generations taking their history class will have trouble wrapping their heads around there even being a need for such a term."
173,"Literally couldn't give a shit, it effects me about as much as two gay people getting married. I'm all for rights for everybody, especially trans people, everyone needs to just chill out."
434,"Gay marriage doesn't require billions of dollars. If people would give space exploration even a tenth of the resources we give to our military industrial complex, *I* would be so happy."
1402,"The same way introducing a constitutional ban on gay marriage will protect Texas from government intrusion into marriage. ""Government intrusion"" has become a catchphrase that they will use for anything they don't want."
1026,"Yeah there is high support from african americans for prop 8. It almost seems like a double standard. They overwhelmingly vote for Obama, but then they vote against gay marriage overwhelmingly. Homophobia is something that runs deep in many african americans, which always strikes me as odd because they know what it's like to be treated like shit just because of who they are."
1186,Technically the Bible says nothing about gay marriage. It only says that sex between two men is on the same level of 'badness' as mixing fabrics.
272,"As a black man I can confirm this, the statues have never been brought up in conversation with anyone I know. Only on social media and the news am I seeing this virtue signaling about it. Also it is mostly millenial blacks that have been indoctrinated by marxists and ghetto blacks who pretty much just read headlines and believe it. Believe it or not most blacks are socially conservative on things like gay marriage and all this gender bullshit. The media and Democrats just influence them because most are not really deep into politics. They just watch the news and catch headlines on social media. I was not even involved until Ron Paul in 2012. Now I am addicted to red pills."
233,"Fair, but come on...were you expecting a pope who supported gay marriage? If so, you are out of your mind. It would be impossible for a pope to be elected who supports gay marriage (at least right now)."
362,"You should argue the state was always wrong, on a principled level, of any sort of social engineering. You should abolish all marriage. You can additionally argue you're trying to protect gay people from the evils of marriage because it sucks you of all ambition and hope for the future."
470,"YES! This was a damned good year for liberals. We kept the Senate, we made gains on cannabis legalization and same-sex marriage, elected the first openly gay senator and re-elected Obama. The Supreme Court will likely finally stop being conservative."
1277,"I am a manager for a Cinemark movie theater, and the CEO, Lee Roy Mitchell, donated 10 million dollars to dismiss the proposition of legalizing gay marriage in California. As well as donating millions to other anti-gay causes around the country."
1775,"We're already as stupid as we're going to get. Senior Citizens have a proven record of being too short sided to pay it forward or put down a legacy for those who will come after them. Trillions in debt, foreign policy in shambles, an Environment on the verge of collapse, All-Time-High wealth inequality, crumbling infrastructure, Healthcare in the toilets--oh, but Gays can marry. So there's that."
547,"My parents are gay, and I think it's had a positive effect on me. I know so many people my age who were ""accidents"". My parents wanted to be parents so bad that they paid a ton of money to have me! Yay for gay marriage!"
140,"As a European, what a load of idealistic garbage. Holy shit can you sound more full of yourself. Yes, I do agree with SOME of the ideas like that most people do think that government is a force for good, and should be fixed and not toppled. I can agree that in some sense SOME European nations see themselves more as collective. And I think some of the stuff about investing in schools and healthcare is true. But a lot of this is some real revisionist history... America may not be perfect, far from it. But it's not some 19th century hellscape. This thing about genociding your neighbors and whatever. Like Europe didn't have and still has it's own share of racism and things we'd quite like to forget about. I'll remind you the U.S. gay marriage before a great deal of European countries, abortion is still illegal in Ireland!?! Europe is undeniably more progressive in many senses, but this just reads as a big circle jerk, that WAY oversimplifies the complex nature of nations and history."
878,"People don't think all trump supporters are racist, but as you said you rolled the dice and look where it's getting you. Trump has already gone on record to say he wants to appoint racist individuals into his cabinet as well as a climate change denier for the environmental section. The problem is it still won't effect you, while on the other hand your LGBTQ+ friends now have to worry for the next 4 years if they can keep their right to marry, hell i worry about Trumps VP pick wanting to bring in conversion therapy. When people get mad at Trump supporters saying ""I'm not racist and I voted for him"" it more the fact that you voted for him despite his racist remarks and plans. You may not be racist, but you don't really care if he brings racists to his cabinet or if he enacts racist policy"
284,Congratulations from Beijing! It's such amazing news for Taiwan and for all the other Asian countries. Hope one day China will legalize gay marriage too. :P
624,"The whole ""he'll set himself on fire"" hooplah was a ridiculous misinterpretation of what he actually said. He said he was willing to burn, in a list of ways he'd be willing to be persecuted. He was still painfully silly - implying he'd be burned at the stake for opposing same sex marriage - but it was ridiculous how people took his words and decided he meant he'd self immolate."
280,"From what I understand, all marriage licenses, not just same sex marriage licenses, will no longer have the clerk's name. While I still think it's stupid and unnecessary, as long as gay couples are still getting the same treatment legally then I think I can live with it."
19,"Wiig is out of his league, and he's gay. He only married olson because she has the body of a 16 year old boy."
1753,Same reason why a chicken sandwich shop decided to fund a campaign against same sex marriage. Some people put personal beliefs above money.
1603,"And ban gay marriage, and allow discrimination, and encourage weapons sales, and go back to the gold standard, and keep people from access to health insurance."
43,"I picked on the cute girl because I liked her. Finally she had enough so she confronted me. We got married 10 years ago and are really happy. Just kidding, she beat the shit out of me and now I am gay."
1352,"Gay marriage. That one pisses me off. She didn't approve of gay marriage until 2013, which is about a decade late, IMO, for a person who calls herself progressive. Incidentally, at about the same time, a poll revealed that more than half of all Americans approved of gay marriage. She has no bedrock convictions. It's impossible to know how and when she'll ""evolve."" Who are you even voting for when you vote for her?"
698,"> Homosexuality was illegal in Uganda under existing colonial laws, he explained, “But nobody was ever arrested or prosecuted based on those old laws. People turned a blind eye to it. Homosexuality was not a political issue.”That changed in 2009, Rev Kaoma said, when a group of American evangelicals led by Pastor Scott Lively, a self-proclaimed expert on the “gay movement”, held a series of talks in Uganda. Mr Lively warned audiences that the “evil institution” of homosexuality sought to “prey upon” and recruit Ugandan children in a bid to “defeat the marriage-based society”."
515,"Excited about what? A debate about abortion, gay marriage and birth control? I guess I would be excited if this were 1955 but seeing as it's actually 2012 I have a feeling that watching two turtles fuck would bring me more excitement."
677,"This is not really a move for the online censorship. It's more of a blow at the entertainment industry in China. Now there will be nothing in TV or movies about the LGBTQ+ online which will further cause duress against the advocation of equal rights in that part of the world. It's actually a huge deal for those who wonder why there is a notification. If they banned heterosexual content then you probably would be outraged, but it just shows how insensitive the world has gotten towards this issue. LGBTQ+ people are treated as sub human. Entire countries persecute and murder them. They care about who we marry, how we adopt, what jobs we have, and where we use the bathroom. Now they care about just shunning us for good. Outrageous. The LGBTQ+ discrimination is equal to, and more often worse than, racism. (In my opinion). China has the highest population, for no one to be allowed to know how wonderful LGBTQ+ people are is robbing them of their and others identities. Robbing them of a world where love has variety. Homo/transphobia is contributed to miseducation, and this will become an even larger part of that culture as it is already."
375,"It is such an infantile argument too. ""Im voting no, not because I have a problem with gay marriage, but because advocates for gay marriage are too aggressive"". It's the adult, democratic version of a dummy spit."
223,"In a mock court battle over gay marriage, I stated to the court that banning same-sex marriage was no different from banning interracial marriage. My opponent countered, wide-eyed, with ""But that was different! *That* was *discrimination!*"""
138,"""I've never listened to his music, but I just *know* he sucks. And he married Kim Kardashian! I don't know why that makes me angry.. but it DOES! I have never made any attempt to learn anything positive he's done. I love hating for the sake of hating. I know nothing about him outside of the over-dramatic media reports, and I have never made any attempt to learn anything about him. Remember that thing he did to Taylor Swift? Yeah. Gay fish asshole. Remember when he called Bush a racist? KANYE is the real racist! AND WHY HE WAS CONSIDERED INFLUENTIAL BY TIME MAGAZINE?! """
171,"Is this question about governmental recognition of same-sex marriages or a moral opposition to same-sex marriage? If it is about governmental recognition of same-sex marriage then I am against it because I don't the government should recognize any marriages. I think marriage should be a personal and/or religious institution and the government should really stay out of that. If it is about moral opposition to same-sex marriage my belief is nearly 100% religious based and I admit that. However leaving religion out of it, I believe that the family unit is the corner stone of a stable society and civilization, and I believe that the ""traditional"" family unit of a man a woman and children is the optimal family unit. However, these are just beliefs absent of hard facts so I can't very well in good conscience inflict them upon someone else thus my answer to why the government should not be involved in marriage."
452,"He actually answered this rather thoughtfully on MSNBC I think the other day, acknowledging that he believes Trump would be much kinder to his industry, Coal, and it would be a self-serving vote, but he is concerned it could mean the erosion of rights that so many have fought hard for such as marriage equality and expanded voting rights and knows a vote for Clinton may be better for the larger ""community."""
1725,"Exactly. It's just a form of cultural conditioning, just like how some conservative Christians view gays as ""literally the devil"" or think that people should not have sex until marriage."
1993,"He's a shitty tactical coach (see offensive system, or lack thereof, calling terrible plays to end games and on inbound passes and his over reliance on being a ""motivator"" to have his teams overcome his coaching shortcomings), he purposefully creates derision in the locker room (see firing of the white mamba, creating an culture of not trusting the management with the members of the team, and bringing Festus to tears by claiming that he was actively rooting against his teammates to create some false fire under his teams ass) , and he's just generally a shitty person (see cheating on his wife with a stripper while shitting on gay marriage and other's ""sins"")"
638,"Many parties do nowadays - all that really matters is specific pledges and action. It's happened before where conservative governments have given vauge promises about the rights of gay people, only to turn around and say ""By the way, we don't consider marriage or adoption a right."""
991,"I fully support gay marriage because I think that individuals who love each other and are in a committed relationship shouldn't be discriminated against and denied the benefits of a legal marriage (tax breaks, etc.). That same argument could be used in defense of incestuous and polygamist marriage, neither of which I support."
440,Sounds like she was dumb. There are perfectly smart people against gay marriage. They generally don't use that sentence though. That's reserved for idiots.
1987,"Back when the U.S. was about to vote in gay marriage I posted ""If you use religion to go against gay marriage you also do not support divorce."" Got loads of ""It's different."" No, no it's not different"
604,"In the UK, one of our crazies said the floods we were experiencing were due to gay marriage. Maybe California isn't having *enough* gay sex."
292,"The Bible is actually explicitly against adultery and divorce, but says nothing about gay marriage. But there's nothing surprising about religious people selectively ignoring their own texts..."
323,"Old people (in their 60s, 70s) think it is typical of homosexuals to marry older women. During the campaign, this was used to portray Macron as a homosexual to older catholics."
492,"exactly. I really don't care or really mind if he still doesn't agree with gay marriage, just as long as he doesn't try and impede on other's human rights."
177,"I'm not fine with people who oppose equal marriage rights. Who the fuck do these people think they are telling other people who they can and cannot get married to? Why should it be okay to legally impose religious beliefs on other people with no moral basis to defend them? I don't see why anyone would even be nice to such a person, they're obviously a cunt."
819,"Though I would argue that NC's state lawmakers are worse. Between the bathroom bill, State constitutional amendment making gay marriage unrecognized, and banning the use of scientific predictions regarding sea level changes when deciding coastal policy. But NC is definitely better in every other way."
1740,"The current 'conservatives' want the government out of their lives with stuff they like doing (guns, etc) When it comes to things they don't like (gay marriage, drug use etc) they want the government to act. People don't want small government, they want a government that does what they want"
1100,"I'm for gay marriage, pro choice, pro legalization of marijuana, against death penalty, to name a few. As I've been saying, liberalism has been hijacked by progressivism and it's only now that many liberals are waking up to that."
1228,"Soon, anyone who isn't having married heterosexual sex in the missionary position under the covers with the lights off is going to identify as ""queer."""
330,"You could always try the subtle-as-a-brick-wall approach and ask him what he thinks about gay marriage or whatever when you both hear it on TV or the radio or something. He'll be uncomfortable and not give much of an answer, then you can share your opinion on the matter and make it clear that gay or straight, you love him unconditionally and would be proud of him. Maybe he comes out to you immediately, maybe he doesn't. Regardless, you'll remove all doubt from his mind and let him focus on accepting himself in the same way you've already accepted him."
241,"They played the whole role, Obama did nothing to legalize gay marriage. Hell, the white house didnt even have an official stance until Biden forced them to."
393,There is this brilliant man who went before the court and did something similar to this. He read an entire argument against gay marriage and then revealed it was an argument used to allow segregation and he just replaced the words. Just YouTube twist ending gay. The reaction however is really minimal. Were I there I would have clapped so loudly
538,Well … I didn’t write the GOP platform. I was on the road working during the GOP convention when the platform was written. I’m not a millionaire career politician like my opponent -- I’ve got to work to pay the bills and so that I can take the next few month off to campaign. I am a Republican because I believe in economic freedom and personal liberty. I believe in the Virginia Republican Creed: http://www.virginia.gop/virginia-republican-creed/ and it doesn’t say anything about marriage equality or climate change. Donald Trump vowed to defend the LGBTQ community -- that’s a good thing. I want to shape the future of the Republican Party and I am proud to represent the next generation of leaders in the Party.
1340,"She's a conservative pundit who says ridiculous things to intentionally rile people up. You might know her as the 'approves of American-soil drone strikes' and 'no gay marriage, but I'm not discriminating' person."
1788,"The great thing about liberal gun-owners is we care about the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th. Its the GOP that worries about the 2nd while defending torture and fearing gay people having access to marriage certificates."
612,"Marriage is an important part of getting ahead: lets people know you're not a homo; married guy seems more stable; people see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch; ladies see the ring, they know immediately you must have some cash or your cock must work."
141,"The core thing is that they are financed by international corporations and will always rule in their favor. This is why they surround themselves with the same old revolving door ""diplomats"" and why issues like abortion and marriage equality are the big issues politicians focus on rather than bank bailouts, corporate welfare, gross income disparity, and constant war, in which little or no difference is to be found between the Democrats and Republicans."
1005,"Some Americans threatened it in response to the US legalizing gay marriage nationwide in 2015, apparently unaware that Canada legalized gay marriage nationwide in 20*0*5."
311,"Beastiality is completely legal in Alabama, Arkansas, DC, Guam, Hawaii, Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The fact that beastiality is legal in the same states that ban gay marriage is mind boggling."
665,"**""I'm at a loss to understand how they can possibly justify crippling one of our most significant national cultural institutions to save a buck, while they are prepared to spend $175 million on a marriage equality plebiscite when they should just do their job and make the decision in the parliament,"" he said.**"
307,"Exactly, saying he's gay isn't actually the big story (other priests have done that), it's telling his congregation to vote for same sex marriage."
26,"Not only that, but Kim Davis got pregnant with her third husband's twins while married to her first husband. Her second husband adopted them before she moved on to her fourth husband. But, gay people have no morals or honor. WTF!!!﻿"
1973,I used to work there. By far my most favorite job. They are great to their employees. They even offered benefits for same sex partners before the whole gay marriage debate became a thing. They give you money towards adoption. They also help you pay for school if you get a degree in certain areas. And of course affordable health insurance for part-time employees.
44,"I really wish politicians would stop with the ""It's lawful"" bullshit and let their actions be judged by common decency. We lawfully rounded up Japanese and interned them in camps. We lawfully kept black people from living in certain neighborhoods. We lawfully kept women from voting. We lawfully kept gay men and women from being married. What is lawful and what is right are frequently not the same."
1421,I work in advertising and this took some BALLZ. It's 2013 we're talking about legalizing gay marriage and I can't even show interracial couples in ads. Think about that.
864,Just wait. Soon they'll be passing laws requiring churches that perform marriages for gay people have hospital admitting privileges to remain open.
517,This was definitely not an accident by her. she isnt the kind of person that makes accidents like that. it was calculated to get it through without losing face. it worked exactly as it should. now a huge talking point of the spd and other parties is gone. gay marriage is a thing now and they cant campaign with it.
689,"Ah let me chime in. In China and even Europe to a large degree you have a ~~hetero~~homogeneous (i'm not even bi curious and I fucked that up sorry) culture, many rules can go unspoken because they have been defined by culture for thousands of years. In the U.S. you have no standard culture, no history, no people, so you HAVE to have all these laws and rules to put everyone on the same playing field. Lawyers in the U.S. are the bad guys (see any lawyer jokes) because they are a substitute for blood feuds and long standing cultural traditions. They are the arbitrators of what in other places are cultural norms. Thus in the U.S. you have a Somali next to a Chinese guy who married a Chaldean... and for the most part we all get along. To do this though we have to have all those stupid rules."
412,"Let's also be honest, I don't care about the politics of an NFL player, coach, owner, or halftime entertainer. I'm watching a game. Just like I don't care about the founder of chick fil a being against gay marriage. I'm eating a sandwich."
246,"Perhaps he wasn't voting against the idea of allowing gays to marry, but instead voting against the precedent that such a ruling sets for our justice system. I haven't read their individual statements though, so maybe someone else could provide some better insight."
147,I am also in a same-sex marriage. My in-laws were cool with me being female but weren't thrilled that I am Jewish. You just can't please everyone.
174,"This answer surprised me. In a good way. Personally, i am for gay marriage, but I am happy to see someone on the other side of the table recognizing the need for equal protection and rights. It makes the debate a semantic one rather than a moral one."
502,"I usually vote for right wing parties, but I've always been extremely supportive of LGBT rights. R/the_donald makes me very proud of where America is on this issue. I'd say 90%+ of people there are supportive of gay marriage. Trump holding up the rainbow flag gets upvotes all the time."
1831,"All the young conservatives I know are pretty libertarian in their beliefs, the days of social conservatives seem to be coming to an end. Younger conservatives generally are for gay marriage because they simply don't believe it's the governments place to legislate morality, Republicans are turning these young voters off with their message."
666,"That's something that has always surprised me. These salt of the earth, manly men look down on people being homophobic. They see it as petty and a waste of time. I'd consider my father to kind of fit into that category. While he may have made some bigoted remarks (jokingly of course), when it came down to it his view on gay marriage and everything concerning homosexuality in general, was to mind your own business."
1060,I don't get your point with healthcare. The Netherlands has a private system yet we were the very first to legalise gay marriage.
471,"White suburban people usually like to think they're accepting and welcoming to minorities and such. In reality, they're okay with minorities so long as they don't act like a minority. Black people are fine just so long as they don't have afros or aren't named Shanequa. Gays are okay and should be able to marry, but I hate it when they flaunt their sexuality (see kissing in public or holding hands)."
809,"Same reasons. If I don't harm you while enjoying my own activity, then you shouldn't prevent me from doing that activity. It's also the same argument for gay marriage or legalizing prostitution. A crime needs to have a victim in order to be a crime."
341,"You should not feel bad about telling him the truth. Just because he is gay doesn't mean he isn't guilty of cheating and ruining your marriage. There is nothing wrong with being gay....at all, but using it as a cop-out to not face the consequences of cheating IS wrong and he should feel ashamed. He isn't courageous for cheating, he's a scumbag just like every other cheater."
352,"Fuck North Carolina, Obama is on the right side of history! I'd rather have a President who believes in equality for 8 months and 4 years of Romney than 8 years of a President who doesn't believe in equality. Hell even Dick Cheney is a huge gay marriage supporter!"
532,"Can confirm, Tennessee state legislators just proposed two new anti-LGBT bills. One is a bathroom bill, and the other essentially bans same-sex marriage. Similar things are going to start happening in other states, and the Trump administration is definitely not going to come out against them."
181,"Alright, this is a bit radical, but…I truly do not understand why there is a debate over whether or not gay marriage affects children while mentally handicapped people are allowed to reproduce."
1127,"Hope beats hate. For all the deaths that she and her ilk laughed at during the 80s, the gay community can be proud of one thing. She went to her death bed knowing same sex marriage was legal every state of the United States of America, not as same sex marriage, not as civil partnership but as marriage."
1879,"In speaking with many liberal proponents of gay marriage, I have found that they are often trying to do right for all the wrong reasons. We can generally agree that it is not the government's business to define marriage, and that they have no business in denying happiness to these individuals. But I have found that quickly abandon their belief system when I bring up the topic of polygamy. According to many of these folk, marriage equality should only extend to those in monogamous relationships and no farther. That is hypocrisy."
1289,"I overheard two people arguing about gay marriage once. The one in favour said ""between five and twenty percent of the population is gay, depending upon your definition of gay"". The guy against was apoplectic, ""*depending on your definition of gay? A bender's a bender!*"" It was quite astonishing how red he went."
1466,"At this point it's entirely expected. The health minister Jeremy Hunt believes in homoeopathy, the previous environmental minister didn't believe in global warming, and the Minister for Equalities opposed same sex marriage."
429,"I'm mostly hung up on the fact that she's a grown-ass woman approaching forty and apparently can't stay overnight by herself without having someone come over to ""cuddle"" her. I know a lot of people don't sleep as well without their SO but sometimes our partners do go out of town, grow the fuck up and deal. I don't have any problem believing the dude is gay or think anything sexual is going on but the whole ""I could have a full-on emotional relationship with someone else with no sex"" would be kind of worrisome to me. You certainly *could*, but...you shouldn't really? Because you're married and aren't supposed to glom on to whoever's closest for emotional fulfillment just because your partner's not right in front of you? Eh."
249,"That's really refreshing to hear. It drove me crazy that she openly opposed gay marriage for decades then flipped just for the election and the gay community thought she was on their side and Trump was going to all but hang them. She even tried to deny it despite multiple recorded interviews! Wikileaks even proved she never really changed her stance. As far as I know, he never said anything that would hurt the community and was the first candidate to proudly wave the flag on stage."
426,"Never understood that particular argument in any case. Allowing gay marriage have absolutely zero impact on straight couples ability to have kids (it's not contagious and it won't magically turn ""normal"" people gay)."
543,Governor Mark Dayton has already said that if a marriage equality bill comes to his desk he will sign it. So all that's left is the senate.
1471,I'm just going to giggle about the implied marriage every time this is cast. Iona & Elesh Norn for marriage equality figureheads?
629,"The child of the gay couple WILL BE IMMEDIATELY harmed by the withdrawal of her parents' right to marriage, the two little hate children are just being used to promote a trashy website. Message aside the content of the photos isn't even very equal."
142,"DAMN. Portugal has proven that it can be done. WHY AREN'T WE DOING IT? Why isn't America an innovator in anything that doesn't involve a handful of people becoming extremely wealthy?? I really wish we could, as a country, start getting back to a place when patriotism meant standing up for and supporting your fellow man when he is down on his luck. You know... ACTUAL Christian ideals, not the artificial, bullshit wedge issues of gay marriage, abortion and the subjugation of women. </rant>"
1079,I had a waiter not only hit on my wife in front of me but then ask while she was in the restroom how solid our marriage was and did he have a shot. He also seemed by all intents and purposes to be flamboyantly gay.
1520,"the party of ""family values"" my ass. His highest support is among white evangelicals, who have completely exposed themselves as ""cultural christians"" who really only want abortion to be banned and for gays not to marry."
16,"There is no longer ""gay"" marriage, it is now just marriage. It isn't a subset or inferior product, it is all uniform and equal. Marriage is no longer an exclusive club, and that's a good thing for all of us."
252,Preventing same-sex marriage. I get that people can be uncomfortable with the idea but spouting that a same sex couple would ruin the sanctity of marriage is bullshit. Last I checked Marriage is about commitment and when you have things like Vegas/shotgun weddings you can't really argue about a same sex couple that are in love getting married.
1526,"It appalls me the number of trump supporters who say, ""Oh no, he's not against gay marriage, he just wants to leave it up to state governments to decide what's fair."" Equality is not a decision dammit. It is an undeniable right to each and every citizen of this country. How is this still even a discussion?"
356,I think any true conservative should be fine with gay marriage. We're supposed to be about less government intrusion into people's lives.
1983,"There was a pervasive effort to paint supporters of anyone running against HRC as out of touch with minorities, women and LGBT folks. This began subtly with her primary race against Bernie. The media could hardly discuss Sanders' success without mentioning that he was doing well with white males. At first I didn't think anything of it, but the frequency of this messaging became obvious. It was their way of signaling to minorities and others that Bernie was an old white man who only cared about white males. Nobody in the traditional media had the nerve to challenge Hillary's claim to ownership over minorities/LGBT/women despite her super predator remarks and history of being anti-gay marriage... even when a photo emerged of Bernie being arrested during a civil rights event decades ago. This tactic may have garnered her some support from underrepresented groups, but it also had the opposite effect of chasing away more of the white vote."
1963,"For me the music video served as a juxtaposition of an arguably disgusting yet acceptable form of heterosexual ""love"" in the spring breakers, and a perfectly civilized yet unaccepted form of love in gay marriage."
760,My ex was always concerned with that she had a legitimate fear that when we got married (we were engaged at one point) that I would leave here in like 10 years for a dude. I'm still not quite sure how to feel about it. I will say that I could totally get why people think I'm gay cause I'm very secure in my sexuality. Totally not attracted to dudes but I can appreciate a well sculpted body.
450,Oh Libertarians can be some of the biggest hypocrites. I remember during the whole gay marriage debate so many Libertarians would twist and turn to defend their stance against gay marriage (and some still do to this day).
881,"The opposite of that argument was heavily used to argue against gay marriage. They were saying it's a slippery slope. They said if gay people can get married next thing you know, people are marrying objects, ideas etc. Guess they were extremely wrong."
653,Clinton and the DNC will raise the minimum wage to $15 the same way Ted Cruz and the repubs will accept gay marriage.....with their fingers crossed behind their back.
558,"I also won't be leaving a $15 to $18 million dollar estate to University of Alabama because of state's war on same-sex marriage. In the event they change their stance on same-sex marriage, then I won't be leaving it to them for my second reason: I'm poor."
495,Has a chapel on campus where a lot of people like to get married. Had a homosexual couple request to reserve the chapel for their wedding and suddenly stopped allowing weddings in the chapel.
165,"I don't even understand how anyone could claim gay marriage keeps the birth rate down. It's not like if two gay guys can't marry, they'll go ""oh well, better impregnate some women instead."" If anything, gay marriage will *increase* the birth rate: if there are more men in stable gay relationships and they decide to have a surrogate bear a child for them."
509,"Didn't Trump win more of the Hispanic vote than Romney did? If the Left keeps on insisting on viewing everything through the prism of identity politics they're going to start losing minority voters, many of whom aren't fully on board with their views on gender, race, and Islam. Hell, even my Hispanic father cared less about his immigration stance than about his connections with Russia, and my traditional Hispanic mother has serious issues with gay marriage and abortion. The concept of a rainbow coalition is a flawed one when many of those same people have social views that are antithetical to those of coastal Leftists."
530,"i am and always have been a very vocal supporter of gay marriage. check out ""my big gay chip"" post on huffington post."
650,"As a gay person I'm very worried about this. It'd be one thing to undo marriage equality and push it back to the states. I'd have to deal with it, maybe move to a blue state, maybe just wait it out. But it could go so much further. In the next four years we could see it banned on a federal level so it doesn't matter where you live. But it might not even stop there. We could end up with anti-gay laws on the level of Russia, where it's illegal to even be gay. At that point, there's no longer a place in this country for me and my wife."
1001,"The judge is a man who is against gay marriage, but has an understanding about the laws of the land are more important to uphold than his own beliefs. There's a good judge sitting on that bench, and the people in his district should be thankful that such a man was appointed."
893,"But the thing is, in 2000 he was interviewed and he believes that Gays should be able to have the legal benefits of a marriage all but in name (Civil Union/Legal Partnership), but he believes Churches should have the right to refuse to do gay weddings on religious grounds. In 2000, you know who was against gay marriage, Hillary Rodham Clinton."
72,"Newt Gingrich wants to ""preserve"" the sanctity of marriage by not allowing gays to get married. The man who's gotten a divorce two different times and cheated on his wife who has cancer wants to preserve the sanctity of marriage. DaFuq."
