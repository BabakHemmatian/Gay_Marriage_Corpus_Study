420,"This is entirely misleading. The law that passed was updating Indiana felonies from ""Class A-D"" to ""Level 1-6."" It did not add any new felonies, but it did state that it is felony fraud to put false or misleading information of a government form. The Marriage application in Indiana has a spot for ""Male applicant"" and ""Female applicant."" Therefore putting two men or two women on the application is fraud. Applying for a same sex marriage turning into a felony was an unintentional consequence of updating the legal code."
28,"I don't know much about the anti-gay marriage movement in France, but if it's similar to America's it's photos like these that show the disgust on these people's faces that proves that this isn't simply about ""Defending the sanctity of marriage"" or some other bs. They are truly disgusted by gay people, for some reason."

30,"This is where I feel like the whole left-right thing breaks down. On the right, at least, there are two distinct and somewhat contradictory positions. There's the traditional ""small government"" conservative, who believes in things like states' rights and limited government regulation, and then there's the ""morality police"" who want to keep the gays from marrying and throw all the potheads in jail.

20,"I am 50 - half a century for me, wow - and the thing that has gotten harder is all the people and pets I knew who have died. You start to hear of people from high school who died. I lost friends during the AIDS crisis. You start to feel as if you've seen so much and it starts to feel overwhelmingly sad. Vets coming home from Vietnam - my first experience with war. Friends who were alive but had essentially lost themselves to drug and alcohol addiction. Remembering getting married and thinking I'd grow old with that person but of course I had no idea what I was doing. At this age, 50, is when you start to contemplate your own mortality and the odd feeling you get, thinking of the world marching on without you and feeling so bad that at some point you will abandon your children to this crazy world without your guidance when they need it. When it starts to really get me down I think of all I have seen. I couldn't have imagined cell phones when I was young, or computers or even call waiting and voicemail, email. None of it. I am so happy as well to see gay people getting married. I try to focus on the positive. Anyway, I don't know if even one person will read this but I feel better for having typed it out."

1832,"Oh man... I am going to get pounded for this but I swear I don't hold this position myself. The best secular argument I've heard against gay marriage is that the legal institution of marriage provides a mechanism for the government to exert leverage upon the population at the macro level by shaping benefits and obligations of marriage to encourage certain outcomes. The most obvious use is to encourage or discourage population growth and home ownership via tax credits and such. In this view, gay marriage is not immoral so much as it is an externality, and appendiceal inefficiency that does not serve the government's purpose of population control and societal shaping."

39,It doesn't fit the narrative but Trump is a very socially liberal Republican. He doesn't care about gays getting married. He doesn't care what bathrooms Trans people use. He's good friends with Kaitlyn Jenner. Pence on the other hand... The amount of people just brainwashed by the media into think Trump will treat LGBT people like Hitler treated Jews is just absurd

422,"Not to be ""that guy"" that critises the map but you should have stuck to a consistent Europe-wide survey rather than random opinion polls. Your figure for the UK for example was a question worded ""Do you think same-sex marriage is right or wrong?"" of which over 17% said Don't Know. The UK got one of the highest scores for LGBT rights in Europe yet this map seems to go against that because of one YouGov poll which was worded differently from the others. Actually support for same-sex marriage in the UK is around 65-80%. I assume you took the figures from the weirdly constructed chart on the ""Recognition of same-sex marriage in Europe"" wiki page"

111,You're joking right? They don't just have different beliefs .. They are supporting not letting gay people marry and adopt kids. Since when are people supposed to accept having their rights taken away? Would you tell a black man to calm down and just accept that he should have to drink from a different water fountain? He should respect those beliefs?
49,"I wasn't hateful towards gays but I was against gay marriage and a bit prejudiced til I moved into an apartment with a gay neighbor. He was a huge sports fan and one the nicest people I've ever met, truly a gem of a guy. He was the first openly gay friend I've had and it made me much more relaxed on the subject. He was just a regular guy and absolutely destroyed any and every stereotype and preconception I had of gay men. Unfortunately he died a few years ago, cancer's a bitch."

175,"This is not necessarily R-rated, but pretty controversial for middle and high schools. Homosexual behavior was actually decently widespread in the 1920s, and becoming more visible. Married men and women would sometimes have lovers of the same sex on the side, and gender roles began to become blurred in popular media. It's actually a very interesting topic.

The same governor fought against gay marriage (in a case with a dying woman who was married to her partner out of state, but needed their benefits to be recognized in Indiana), is promising to appeal his loss in trying to stop Syrian refugees from being settled in the state, and now this. All of this is one year after he got in hot water nationally for signing and supporting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was widely criticized for allowing descrimination against gays and trans individuals."

199,"It feels like Bernie is one of the only politicians that gets any media coverage that is openly saying ""Corruption is rampant in Washington"", ""Gay marriage should be legal"", ""Marijuana should be legal"", ""Corporations are the driving force behind fuckhead politicians."" So many politicians receive a $10,000+ check and vote in favor of lower standards for citizens. Lower standards for health, for rights, for accountability, for transparency, for freedoms. These fuckheads are voting with the dollar, and Bernie seems to be a loud voice over the nonsense. If he gets elected I think President Sanders will be a name that will be remembered. I will vote for him. In my phone's calendar I have put, on November 1st, ""Voting day November 3rd."", on November 2nd I've put, ""Vote tomorrow you asshole"" and on November 3rd, I've put ""Vote today you lazy complacent shithead.""

165,"I don't even understand how anyone could claim gay marriage keeps the birth rate down. It's not like if two gay guys can't marry, they'll go ""oh well, better impregnate some women instead."" If anything, gay marriage will *increase* the birth rate: if there are more men in stable gay relationships and they decide to have a surrogate bear a child for them."
36,I'm not sure if i'm relieved or even more deeply disheartened by the thought that this probably doesn't have anything to do with a position on gay marriage and everything to do with a corporate policy that moves way past the spirit and intent of policies and actively seeks loopholes and ways out of paying benefits.
337,"I almost wonder if it would have happened as quickly if the movement to oppress it hadn't been as forceful. I'm not sure the gay marriage movement would have been quite as quick or reactive. So, I'd like to say thank you in part to all of the bigots for making this day possible."

459,"I went to a Burger King once and saw a nice Muslim woman in a hijab dishing out bacon double-cheeseburgers like a champ. Your religion does not prevent you from serving bacon or liquor or marrying gays or sheep. You, or your local religious leader made up these rules. Ask the Pope or major Imam in your area, they will suggest that you do what you need to do to keep your job."
372,"Because it reveals how devoid of humanity they are. Gay people don't need this heterophobic bigotry; it's the very propaganda homophobes push, that straight marriage would be destroyed if gay marriage was allowed."
251,"Nobody has ever argued that same sex marriage is ""gay privilege"". Churches don't pay taxes because they are non-profits, not because they are churches. Plus, gay people are allowed that exact same tax-free privilege if they start their own church or any other non-profit. They should really be careful with that edge. They are in grave danger of being cut."

92,"I think that we are reaching a tipping point globally in regards to Cannabis legalisation. Governments across the world are realising the futility and self defeating nature of the War on Drugs and are starting to think again. By the end of the decade, it's likely that a majority of American States will have decriminalised or legalised cannabis. Even the Irish Government is starting to reconsider their stance on Drugs legislation. Like with Same Sex Marriage, we could see a rapid change in popular opinion on this issue."
46,That gay marriage is still an actual argument and there are prominent/powerful people in our country who are publicly against it.

1485,"Actually it's because roaches started allowing gay marriage, simultaneously destroying the integrity of every roach family and also halting new births."
1869,"I believe you're misusing the term progressive. You mean to call her relatively liberal (in terms of the American spectrum). Supporting gay marriage is not progressive at this point, for instance. It's the status quo. It's what the majority of Americans support. She does hold some progressive ideas, but they are few and far between, and she'd mainly provide the same moderate and slow progress in different areas that we've mostly seen the last 8 years. She doesn't want to levy a progressive tax against corporations and wall street."
1681,"Lil B is hands down the best rapper in the world right now. He is not pretty good, he is pretty incredible. But more than just how good he is, He represents the first ripple in a massive change that we are about to go through musically as well as culturally. I think that over the course of the next 10 years we are going to see a sort of mini-renaissance similar to what we saw in the late 50s-60s post war. With pot and gay marriage soon to be legal federally its gonna be a whole new world. 2012 end of the world isn't the end of human life, its the end of one way of thinking and the start of another. Pot...cash...crop...money! As someone already said here on reddit, The united states will be the only country in the world were pot is legal federally. We are gonna have jobs again, and money to burn. Money to spend on art and music. In a sense, a need will be created for GOOD art and music. Not something that is coldy manufactured by hitmakers. Lil B is leading the charge! He is proving that people CAN tell the difference between real and manufactured music! Im not saying Lil B are the next Beatles but they are making enough waves to make change. Moral of story, Lil B Rocks!!!! He (The Based God) is making real beautiful music that only happens when a talented person commits a lot of time to something that they are passonate about. Lil B is a real life ""bedroom"" rapper, they way it is meant to be."
1798,"Ooh ooh the intersection of feminism and sex workers is actually really interesting! Because in the past, in order to join mainstream American society, groups (meaning anyone like nonwhite or nonmale) basically had to prove that they were moral and nonthreatening and stuff. Think about how Jews are basically portrayed as nebbishes (in Woody Allen films, even Jon Stewart), or how gay couples are starting to portray themselves as just wanting to get married and raise children rather than crazy drug-using swingers as they were in earlier eras. So although prostitutes had been some of the earliest financially self-sufficient women, in order for women to really join mainstream society and get the vote, feminists (suffragettes in those days) had to reject them! In feminist thought today (don't make the mistake of thinking there's only ONE way of looking at the world from a feminist viewpoint, it's an ongoing dialog), there's actually a lot of divisiveness about this issue, with some arguing that sex workers are exploited and some arguing, as you do, that women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and so on. I think it's actually really interesting."

726,"Simply put, science is repeatable for everyone - you can find your own evidence. If I tell you gravity exists, you can test it yourself. You can take a pencil and drop it one hundred times and it will always drop. I can show other people my data and repeat my experiments to show them that gravity works. Religion is not repeatable for everyone - if it were, everyone would convert to one 'true' religion. You and I can both pray to different gods - you to Allah and me to Zeus, and we can both feel spiritual and receive 'revelation'. But then if I pray to Allah and you pray to Zeus, odds are you won't feel a thing *because you don't believe in Zeus.* So when I tell you that Zeus told me gay marriage is holy and good, you won't be able to believe me because my word isn't evidence for you. My parents are mormon. They believe that God and Jesus talk to them directly, and that if *anyone* reads the book of mormon and prays about it, god will let them know that the book is true and the mormon church is the *only* true church. My parents will not listen to any other ideas or reasoning about religion because for them their prayers are concrete evidence for their faith. I have read and prayed about their book for years and have never felt anything, even though I sincerely wanted to believe it.
