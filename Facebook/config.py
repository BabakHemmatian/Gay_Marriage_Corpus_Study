# All data files created by this package will be stored in DATA_DIR.
# 
# Due to restrictions of the tar utility (or, more likely, this developer's 
# lack of knowledge of how to use it) it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that 
# DATA_DIR
# 1) be nested within and named relative to the current working directory 
#    (i.e. no:
#     absolute paths (beginning with "/"),
#     ".", or
#     "..")
# 2) not contain spaces.
