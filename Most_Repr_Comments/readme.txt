Includes only comments for topics that were significant predictors of consequentialist or protected-values-based discourse in more than a quarter of ten ten-fold cross-validations as described in the manuscript, and as determined using R code included in the folder "Regression_Analyses". You can use the top topic sampling functions provided in the repository to produce similar files for any combination of topics. 

Use indices from sample_keys to find the text of the relevant comment in sampled_comments. Random index assignment via a spearate file was meant to facilitate non-biased sampling of comments.

Reported contributions of the most likely topics are from the LDA model with 50 topics. Please contact developers for similar files based on different numbers of topics
